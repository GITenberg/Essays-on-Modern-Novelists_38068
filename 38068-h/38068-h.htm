<p>Some of the essays in this volume have appeared
in recent numbers of various periodicals. The
essays on "Mark Twain" and "Thomas Hardy"
were originally printed in the <i>North American Review</i>;
those on "Mrs. Ward" and "Rudyard Kipling,"
in the <i>Forum</i>; those on "Alfred Ollivant,"
"Björnstjerne Björnson," and "Novels as a University
Study," in the <i>Independent</i>. The same
magazine contained a portion of the present essay
on "Lorna Doone," while the article on "The
Teacher's Attitude toward Contemporary Literature"
was written for the <i>Chicago Interior</i>. My
friend, Mr. Andrew Keogh, Reference Librarian
of Yale University, has been kind enough to prepare
the List of Publications, thereby increasing
my debt to him for many previous favours.</p>

<p>"How can you know whether you are successful
or not at forty-one? How do you know you won't
have a tremendous success, all of a sudden? Yes&mdash;after
another ten years, perhaps&mdash;but <i>some</i>
time! And then twenty years of real, happy work.
It has all been before, this sort of thing. Why not
you?" Thus spoke the hopeful Alice to the despairing
Charley; and it makes an interesting comment
on the very man who wrote the conversation, and
created the speakers. It has indeed "all been before,
this sort of thing"; only when an extremely
clever person, whose friends have always been saying,
with an exclamation rather than an interrogation
point appended, "Why don't you write a novel!"
... waits until he has passed his grand climacteric,
he displays more faith in Providence than in himself.
All of which is as it should be. Keats died at the
age of twenty-five, but, from where I am now writing,
I can reach his Poetical Works almost without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
leaving my chair; he is among the English Poets.
Had Mr. De Morgan died at the age of twenty-five?
The answer is, he didn't. I am no great
believer in mute, inglorious Miltons, nor do I think
that I daily pass potential novelists in the street.
Life is shorter than Art, as has frequently been observed;
but it seems long enough for Genius. Genius
resembles murder in that it <i>will</i> out; you can no
more prevent its expression than you can prevent
the thrush from singing his song twice over.
Crabbed age and youth have their peculiar accent.
Keats, with all his glory, could not have written
<i>Joseph Vance</i>, and Mr. De Morgan, with all his
skill in ceramics, could not have fashioned the <i>Ode
on a Grecian Urn</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne, who loved miracles, did not
hesitate to classify the supposed importance of the
grand climacteric as a vulgar error; he included a
whole quaint chapter on the subject, in that old
curiosity shop of literature, the <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>.
"And so perhaps hath it happened unto
the number 7. and 9. which multiplyed into themselves
doe make up 63. commonly esteemed the
great Climactericall of our lives; for the dayes of
men are usually cast up by septenaries, and every
seventh yeare conceived to carry some altering character
with it, either in the temper of body, minde,
or both; but among all other, three are most remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
that is, 7. times 7. or forty-nine, 9. times 9.
or eighty-one, and 7. times 9. or the yeare of sixty-three;
which is conceived to carry with it, the most
considerable fatality, and consisting of both the
other numbers was apprehended to comprise the
vertue of either, is therefore expected and entertained
with feare, and esteemed a favour of fate to
pass it over; which notwithstanding many suspect
but to be a Panick terrour, and men to feare they
justly know not what; and for my owne part, to
speak indifferently, I find no satisfaction, nor any
sufficiency in the received grounds to establish a
rationall feare."</p>

<p>Among various strong reasons against this superstition,
Dr. Browne presents the impressive argument
shown by the Patriarchs: "the lives of our forefathers
presently after the flood, and more especially
before it, who, attaining unto 8. or 900. yeares, had
not their Climacters computable by digits, or as we
doe account them; for the great Climactericall was
past unto them before they begat children, or gave
any Testimony of their virilitie, for we read not that
any begat children before the age of sixtie five."</p>

<p>The strange case of William De Morgan would
have deeply interested Sir Thomas, and he would
have given it both full and minute consideration.
For it was just after he had safely passed the climacterical
year of sixty-three, that our now famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
novelist began what is to us the most important
chapter of his life, the first chapter of <i>Joseph Vance</i>;
and, like the Patriarchs, it was only after he had
reached the age of sixty-five that he became fruitful,
producing those wonderful children of his brain
that are to-day everywhere known and loved. Poets
ripen early; if a man comes to his twenty-fifth
birthday without having written some things supremely
well, he may in most instances abandon all
hope of immortality in song; but to every would-be
novelist it is reasonable to whisper those encouraging
words, "while there's life there's hope." Of
the ten writers who may be classed as the greatest
English novelists, only one&mdash;Charles Dickens&mdash;published
a good novel before the age of thirty.
Defoe's first fiction of any consequence was <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, printed in 1719; he was then fifty-eight
years old. Richardson had turned fifty before his
earliest novel appeared. And although I can think
at this moment of no case exactly comparable with
that of the author of <i>Joseph Vance</i>, it is a book to
which experience has contributed as well as inspiration,
and would be something, if not inferior, at all
events very different, had it been composed in early
or in middle life. For it vibrates with the echoes
of a long gallery, whose walls are crowded with interesting
pictures.</p>

<p>The recent Romantic Revival has produced many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
novels that have enjoyed a brief and noisy popularity;
its worst effects are noticeable on the minds of readers,
unduly stimulated by the constant perusal of rapid-fire
fiction. Many will not read further than the
fourth page, unless some casualties have already
occurred. To every writer who starts with some
deliberation, they shout, "Leave your damnable
faces and begin." Authors who produce for immediate
consumption are prepared for this; so are
the more clever men who write the publishers'
advertisements. An announcement of a new work
by an exceedingly fashionable novelist was headed
by the appetising line, "This book goes with
a rush, and ends with a smash." That would
hardly do as a description of <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>,
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, or some other classics. To a
highly nervous and irritably impatient reading public,
a man whose name had no commercial value in
literature gravely offered in the year of grace 1906
an "ill-written autobiography" of two hundred
and eighty thousand words! Well, the result is
what might <i>not</i> have been expected. If ever a
confirmed optimist had reason to feel justification
of his faith, Mr. De Morgan must have seen it in
the reception given to his first novel.</p>

<p>Despite the great length of Mr. De Morgan's
books, and the leisurely passages of comment and
rather extraneous detail, he never <i>begins</i> slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
No producer of ephemeral trash, no sensation-monger,
has ever got under way with more speed,
or taken a swifter initial plunge into the very heart
of action. One memorable day in 1873, Count
Tolstoi picked up a little story by Pushkin, which
his ten-year-old son had been reading aloud to a
member of the family. The great Russian glanced
at the first sentence, "The guests began to assemble
the evening before the <i>fête</i>." He was mightily
pleased. "That's the way to begin a story!" he
cried. "The reader is taken by one stroke into
the midst of the action. Another writer would have
commenced by describing the guests, the rooms,
while Pushkin&mdash;he goes straight at his goal."
Some of those in the room laughed, and suggested
that Tolstoi himself appropriate such a beginning
and write a novel. He immediately retired and
wrote the first sentences of <i>Anna Karenina</i>; which
is literally the manner in which that masterpiece
came into being.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now if one will open any of Mr.
De Morgan's works, he will find the procedure that
Tolstoi praised. Something immediately happens&mdash;happens
before we have any idea of the real character
of the agents, and before we hardly know where
we are. Indeed, the first chapter of <i>Somehow Good</i>
may serve as an artistic model for the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of a novel. It is written with extraordinary
vivacity and spirit. But the author understands
better how to begin his works than he does how to
end them. The close of <i>Joseph Vance</i> is like the
mouth of the Mississippi, running off into the open
sea through a great variety of passages. The ending
of <i>Alice-for-Short</i> is accomplished only by notes,
comment, and citations. And <i>Somehow Good</i> is simply
snipped off, when it might conceivably have proceeded
on its way. His fourth novel is the only one
that ends as well as it begins.</p>

<p>You cannot judge books, any more than you can
individuals, by the first words they say. If I could
only discover somewhere some man, woman, or child
who had not read <i>Joseph Vance</i>, I should like to
tell him the substance of the first chapter, and ask
him to guess what sort of a story had awakened my
enthusiasm. Suppose some person who had never
heard of Browning should stumble on <i>Pauline</i>, and
read the first three lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Pauline, mine own, bend o'er me&mdash;thy soft breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall pant to mine&mdash;bend o'er me&mdash;thy sweet eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loosened hair and breathing lips, and arms"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>one sees the sharp look of expectation on the reader's
face, and one almost laughs aloud to think what
there is in store for him. He will very soon exhibit
symptoms of bewilderment, and before he has finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the second page he will push the book aside
with an air of pious disappointment. No slum
story ever opened more promisingly than <i>Joseph
Vance</i>. We are led at the very start into a dirty
rum-shop; there immediately ensues a fight between
two half-drunken loafers in the darkness without;
this results in the double necessity of the police and
the hospital; and a broken bottle, found against
a dead cat, is the missile employed to destroy a
human eye. In <i>Alice-for-Short</i>, the first chapter
shows us a ragged little girl of six carrying a jug of
beer from a public-house to a foul basement, where
dwell her father and mother, both victims of alcohol.
The police again. On the third page of <i>Somehow
Good</i>, we have the "fortune to strike on a rich vein
of so-called life in a London slum." The hero
gives a drunken, murderous scoundrel a "blow like
the kick of a horse, that lands fairly on the eye
socket with a cracking concussion that can be heard
above the tumult, and is followed by a roar of delight
from the male vermin." Once more the police.
<i>It Never Can Happen Again</i> begins in a corner of
London unspeakably vile.</p>

<p>Zola and Gorky at their best, and worst&mdash;for
it is sometimes hard to make the distinction&mdash;have
not often surpassed the first chapters of Mr. De
Morgan's four novels. Never has a writer waded
more unflinchingly into the slime. And yet the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
last word to characterise these books would be the
word "slum-stories." The foundations of Mr. De
Morgan's work, like the foundations of cathedrals, are
deep in the dirt; but the total impression is one of
exceeding beauty. Indeed, with our novelist's conception
of life, as a progress toward something high
and sublime, where evil not only exists, but is a
necessary factor in development, the darkness of
the shadows proves the intense radiance of the sun.
The planet Venus is so bright, we are accustomed
to remark, that it sometimes casts a shadow. Christopher
Vance emerges from beastly degradation to
a position of power, influence, and usefulness; the
Heath family, in receiving Alice, entertain an angel
unawares; and the march of <i>Somehow Good</i> goes
from hell, through purgatory, and into paradise.
It is a divine comedy, in more ways than one; and
shows that sometimes the goal of ill is very unlike
the start.</p>

<p>We had not read far into <i>Joseph Vance</i> before we
shouted <i>Dickens Redivivus!</i> or some equivalent
remark in the vernacular. We made this outcry
with no tincture of depreciation and with no yelp
of the plagiarism-hunting hound. It requires little
skill to observe the similarity to Dickens, as was
proved by the fact that everyone noticed it. In
general, the shout was one of glad recognition; it
was the welcome given to the sound of a voice that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
had been still. It was not an imitation: it was a
reincarnation. The spirit of Dickens had really
entered into William De Morgan; many chapters
in <i>Joseph Vance</i> sounded as if they had been dictated
by the ghost of the author of <i>Copperfield</i>. No
book since 1870 had given so vivid an impression
of the best-beloved of all English novelists. This
is meant to be high praise. When Walt Whitman
was being exalted for his unlikeness to the great
poets, one sensible critic quietly remarked, "It is
easier to differ from the great poets than to resemble
them." To "remind us of Dickens" would be as
difficult for many modern novelists as for a molehill
to remind us of the Matterhorn.</p>

<p>We may say, however, that <i>Joseph Vance</i> and
<i>It Never Can Happen Again</i> are more like Dickens
in character and in detail than is <i>Alice-for-Short</i>;
and that the latter is closer to Dickens than is <i>Somehow
Good</i>. The Reverend Benaiah Capstick infallibly
calls to mind the spiritual adviser of Mrs.
Weller; with the exception that the latter was also
spirituous. That kind of religion does not seem
strongly to appeal to either novelist; for Mr.
Stiggins took to drink, and Capstick to an insane
asylum. There are many things in the conversation
of Christopher Vance that recall the humorous
world-wisdom of the elder Weller; and so we might
continue, were it profitable. Another great point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of resemblance between Mr. De Morgan and
Dickens is seen in the method of narration chosen
by each. Here William De Morgan is simply following
in the main track of English fiction, where the
novelist cannot refrain from <i>editing</i> the text of the
story. The course of events is constantly interrupted
by the author's gloss. Now when the
author's mind is not particularly interesting, the
comment is an unpleasant interruption; it is both
impertinent and dull. But when the writer is himself
more profound, more clever, and more entertaining
than even his best characters, we cannot
have too much of him. It is true that Mr. De
Morgan has told a good story in each of his novels;
but it is also true that the story is not the cause
of their reputation. We read these books with delight
because the characters are so attractive, and because
the author's comments on them and on events are
so penetrating. If it is true, as some have intimated,
that this method of novel-writing proves that Mr.
De Morgan, whatever he is, is not a literary artist,
then it is undeniable that Fielding, Dickens, Trollope,
and Thackeray are not artists; which is absurd,
as Euclid would say. Great books are invariably
greater than our definitions of them. Browning
and Wagner composed great works of Art without
paying much attention to the rules of the game.</p>

<p>As compared with French and Russian fiction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
English novels from Fielding to De Morgan have
unquestionably sounded a note of insincerity. One
reason for this lies in the fact that to the Anglo-Saxon
mind, Morality has always seemed infinitely
more important than Art. Matthew Arnold spent
his life fighting the Philistines; but when he said
that conduct was three-fourths of life, there was
jubilation in the enemy's camp. Now Zola declared
that a novel could no more be called immoral in
its descriptions than a text-book on physiology;
the novelist commits a sin when he writes a badly
constructed sentence. A disciple of this school insisted
that it was more important to have an accurate
sense of colour than to have a clear notion of right
and wrong. Fortunately for the true greatness
of humanity, you never can get the average Englishman
or American to swallow such doctrine. But
it is at the same time certain that among English-speaking
peoples Art has seldom been taken with
sufficient seriousness. We are handy with our fists;
but you cannot imagine us using them in behalf of
literature, as we do for real or personal property.
So far as I know, an English audience in the theatre
has never been excited on a purely artistic question&mdash;a
matter of frequent occurrence on the Continent.
We seem to believe that, after all, Art has no place
in the serious business of life; it is a recreation, to
amuse a mind overstrained by money-making or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
by political affairs. We leave it to women, who are
supposed to have more leisure for trifles.</p>

<p>For this reason, English novelists have generally
felt compelled to treat their public as a tired mother
treats a restless child. Our novelists have been in
mortal terror lest the attention of their audience
should wander; and instead of taking their work
and their readers seriously, they continually hand
us lollipops. Their attitude is at once apologetic
and insulting. They do not dare to believe that a
great work of Art&mdash;without personal comment&mdash;has
in itself moral greatness, and they do not dare
trust the intelligence of spectators, but must forsooth
constantly break the illusion by soothing or explanatory
remarks. The fact that in our greatest
writers this is often presented from the standpoint
of humour, does not prevent the loss of illusion; and
in writers who are not great, the reader feels nothing
but indignation. In the first chapter of the third
book of <i>Amelia</i>, we find the following advice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"He then proceeded as Miss Matthews desired; but, lest
all our readers should not be of her opinion, we will, according
to our usual custom, endeavour to accommodate ourselves to
every taste, and shall, therefore, place this scene in a chapter
by itself, which we desire all our readers who do not love, or
who, perhaps, do not know the pleasure of tenderness, to pass
over; since they may do this without any prejudice to the
thread of the narrative."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first chapter of <i>Shirley</i>, Charlotte Brontë<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
prologises as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"If you think ... that anything like a romance is preparing
for you, reader, you never were more mistaken.... Calm
your expectations; reduce them to a lowly standard.
Something real, cool, and solid lies before you;... It is
not positively affirmed that you shall not have a taste of the
exciting, perhaps toward the middle and close of the meal,
but it is resolved that the first dish set upon the table shall be
one that a Catholic&mdash;ay, even an Anglo-Catholic&mdash;might
eat on Good Friday in Passion Week; it shall be cold lentils
and vinegar without oil; it shall be unleavened bread with
bitter herbs, and no roast lamb."</p></blockquote>

<p>William Black once wrote a novel called <i>Madcap
Violet</i>, which he intended for a tragedy, and in which,
therefore, we have a right to expect some artistic
dignity. About midway in the volume we find the
following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"At this point, and in common courtesy to his readers,
the writer of these pages considers himself bound to give fair
warning that the following chapter deals solely and wholly
with the shooting of mergansers, curlews, herons, and such
like fearful wild fowl; therefore, those who regard such
graceless idling with aversion, and are anxious to get on
with the story, should at once proceed to chapter twenty-three."</p></blockquote>

<p>At the beginning of the second chapter of <i>Dr. Thorne</i>,
one of the best of Trollope's novels, we are petted
in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A few words must still be said about Miss Mary before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
we rush into our story; the crust will then have been broken,
and the pie will be open to the guests."</p></blockquote>

<p>At the three hundred and seventy-second page of
the late Marion Crawford's entertaining story,
<i>The Prima Donna</i>, the course of the narrative is
thus interrupted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Now at this stage of my story it would be unpardonable
to keep my readers in suspense, if I may suppose that any of
them have a little curiosity left. Therefore, I shall not narrate
in detail what happened Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,
seeing that it was just what might have been expected to happen
at a week-end party during the season when there is
nothing in the world to do but to play golf, tennis, or croquet,
or to write or drive all day, and to work hard at bridge all
the evening; for that is what it has come to."</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, in the first chapter of Mr. Winston
Churchill's novel, <i>Coniston</i>, the author pleads with
his reader in this style:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The reader is warned that this first love-story will, in
a few chapters, come to an end; and not to a happy end&mdash;otherwise
there would be no book. Lest he should throw
the book away when he arrives at this page, it is only fair to
tell him that there is another and much longer love-story
later on, if he will only continue to read, in which, it is hoped,
he may not be disappointed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Imagine Turgenev or Flaubert scribbling anything
similar to the interpolations quoted above! When
a great French novelist does condescend to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to his reader, it is in a tone, that so far from belittling
his own art, or sugaring the expectation of
his listener, has quite the contrary effect. On the
second page of <i>Père Goriot</i>, we find the following
solemn warning:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Ainsi ferez-vous, vous qui tenez ce livre d'une main
blanche, vous qui vous enfoncez dans un molleux fauteuil
en vous disant: 'Peut-être ceci va-t-il m'amuser.' Après
avoir lu les secrètes infortunes du père Goriot, vous dînerez
avec appétit en mettant votre insensibilité sur le compte de
l'auteur, en le taxant d'exagération, en l'accusant de poésie.
Ah! sachez-le: ce drame n'est ni une fiction ni un roman.
<i>All is true</i>, il est si véritable, que chacun peut en reconnaître
les éléments chez soi, dans son c&oelig;ur peut-être."</p></blockquote>

<p>The chief objection to these constant remarks
to the reader, so common in great English novels,
is that they for the moment destroy the illusion.
Suppose an actress in the midst of Ophelia's mad
scene should suddenly pause and address the audience
in her own accents in this wise: "I observe that
some ladies among the spectators are weeping, and
that some men are yawning. Allow me to say to
those of you who dislike tragic events on the stage,
that I shall remain here only a few moments longer,
and shall not have much to say; and that if you
will only be patient, the grave-diggers will come on
before long, and it is probable that their conversation
will amuse you."</p>

<p>The two reasons given above, the fear that a novel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
unexplained by author's comment will not justify
itself morally, and that at all hazards the gentle
reader must be placated and entertained, undoubtedly
partly explain a long tradition in the course of English
fiction. But while we may protest against this sort
of thing in general, it is well to remember that we
must take our men of genius as we find them, and
rejoice that they have seen fit to employ any channel
of expression. There are many different kinds of
great novels, as there are of great poems. The fact
that Tennyson's poetry belongs to the first class
does not in the least prevent the totally different
poetry of Browning from being ranked equally high.
<i>Joseph Vance</i> is a very different kind of novel from
<i>The Return of the Native</i>, but both awaken our
wonder and delight. There are some books that
inspire us by their art, and there are others that
inspire us by their ideas. Turgenev was surely
a greater artist than Tolstoi, but <i>Anna Karenina</i>
is a veritable piece of life.</p>

<p>I do not say that William De Morgan is not a
great artist, because, if I should say it, I should not
know exactly what I meant. But the immense
pleasure that his books give me is another kind of
pleasure than I receive from <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>.
<i>Joseph Vance</i> is not so much a beautifully written
or exquisitely constructed novel as it is an encyclopædia
of life. We meet real people, we hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
delightful conversation, and the tremendously interesting
personality of the author is everywhere apparent.
The opinion of many authors concerning
immortality is not worth attention; but I should
very much like to know Mr. De Morgan's views
on this absorbing subject. And so I turn to
the fortieth chapter of <i>Joseph Vance</i> with great expectations.
The reader is advised to skip this
chapter, a sure indication of its importance. For,
like all humorists, Mr. De Morgan is a bit shamefaced
when he talks about the deepest things, the
things that really interest him most. It surely will
not do to have Dr. Thorpe talk like the Reverend
Mr. Capstick, although they both eagerly discuss
what we call the supernatural. Capstick is an ass,
but he has one characteristic that we might, to a
certain extent, imitate; he sees no reason to apologise
for conversing on great topics, or to break up such
a conversation with an embarrassed laugh. Most of
us are horribly afraid of being taken for sanctimonious
persons, when there is really not the slightest danger.
We are always pleasantly surprised when
we discover that our friends are at heart just as
serious as we are, and that they, too, regret the mask
of flippancy that our Anglo-Saxon false modesty compels
us to wear. But, as some one has said, you
cannot expect your audience to take your views
seriously unless you express them with seriousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Mr. De Morgan, like Robert Browning, would doubtless
deny that Dr. Thorpe spoke only the author's
thoughts; but just as you can hear Browning's
voice all through those "utterances of so many
imaginary persons, not mine," so I feel confident
that amid all the light banter of this charming talk
in the fortieth chapter, the following remark of Dr.
Thorpe expresses the philosophy of William De
Morgan, and at the same time the basal moral principle
underlying this entire novel:&mdash;"The highest
good is the growth of the Soul, and the greatest
man is he who rejoices most in great fulfilments
of the will of God."</p>

<p>For although Mr. De Morgan belongs, like
Dickens, to the great humorists, who, while keenly
conscious of the enormous difference between right
and wrong, regard the world with a kindly smile
for human weakness and folly, he is mainly a psychologist.
To all of his novels he might appropriately
have prefixed the words of the author of <i>Sordello</i>:
"My stress lay on the incidents in the development
of a soul; little else is worth study." All the characters
that he loves show <i>soul-development</i>; the few
characters that are unlovely have souls that do not
advance. Joseph, Lossie, Janey, Alicia, Charles
Heath, Rosalind, Athelstan, have the inner man renewed
day by day; one feels that at physical death
such personalities proceed naturally into a sphere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
eternal progress. On the other hand, Joey's soul
stands still; so do the souls of Violet, Lavinia Straker,
Mrs. Vereker, Mrs. Eldridge, Judith, and Mrs. Craik.
Why should they live for ever? They would always
be the same. This is the real distinction in these
novels between people that are fundamentally good
and those that are fundamentally bad; whether their
badness causes tragedy or merely constant irritation.
It is an original manner of dividing virtue from vice,
but it is illuminating.</p>

<p>The events in Mr. De Morgan's books are improbable,
but the people are probable. The same
might be said of Shakespeare. It is highly improbable
that Christopher Vance could have risen
to fortune through his sign-board, or that Fenwick
should have been electrocuted at the feet of
his wife's daughter. But Christopher Vance, Fenwick,
and Sally behave precisely as people would
behave in such emergencies in real life. In many
ways I think Christopher Vance is the most convincing
character in all the novels; at any rate, I
had rather hear him talk than any of the others.
There is no trace of meanness in him, and even when
he is drunk he is never offensive or disgusting. The
day after he has returned intoxicated from a meeting
of the Board of Arbitrators, he seems rather inquisitive
as to his exact condition, and asks his son:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I wasn't singin' though, Nipper, was I?" I said certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
not! "Not 'a Landlady of France she loved an
Officer, 'tis said,' nor 'stick 'em up again in the middle of
a three-cent pie'?"</p>

<p>"Neither of them&mdash;quite certain." My father seemed
reassured. "That's <i>something</i>, anyhow," said he. "The
other Arbitrators was singin' both. Likewise 'Rule Britannia.'
Weak-headed cards, the two on 'em!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The scene at Christopher Vance's death-bed, when
Joseph finally discloses the identity of the boy who
threw the piece of glass into the eye of the Sweep,
touches the depths of true pathos. One feels the
infinite love of the father for the little son who defended
him. He is quite rightly prouder of that
exploit than of all the Nipper's subsequent learning.</p>

<p>While the imaginary events in this novel bear no
sort of relation to the circumstances of the author's
own life, I cannot help launching the mere guess that
the father of William De Morgan was, to a certain
extent, a combination of Christopher Vance and Dr.
Thorpe. For Augustus De Morgan was not only
a distinguished mathematical scholar, he was well-known
for the keenness of his wit. He had the
learning and refinement of Dr. Thorpe, and the
shrewd, irresistible humour of old Vance. At all
events, this striking combination in the novelist
can be traced to no more probable source.</p>

<p>The influence of good women on men's lives is
repeatedly shown; it is indeed a leading principle
in three of the books. One of the most notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
differences in novels that reflect a pessimistic <i>Weltanschauung</i>
from those that indicate the contrary
may be seen right here. How completely the
whole significance of the works of Guy de Maupassant
would change had he included here and
there some women who combined virtue with personal
charm! "Were there no women, men would
live like gods," said a character in one of Dekker's
plays; judged by much modern fiction, one would
feel like trying the experiment. But what would
become of Mr. De Morgan's novels, and of the
attitude toward life they so clearly reflect, if they
contained no women? Young Joseph Vance was
fortunate indeed in having in his life the powerful
influence of two such characters as Lossie Thorpe
and Janey Spencer. They were what a compass is
to a shipman, taking him straight on his course
through the blackest storms. It was for Lossie
that he made the greatest sacrifice in his whole
existence; and nothing pays a higher rate of moral
interest than a big sacrifice. It was Janey who
led him from the grossness of earth into the spiritual
world, something that Lossie, with all her loveliness,
could not do. Both women show that there is
nothing inherently dull in goodness; it may be accompanied
with some <i>esprit</i>. We are too apt to
think that moral goodness is represented by such
persons as the Elder Brother in the story of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Prodigal Son, when the parable indicates that the
younger brother, with all his crimes, was actually
the more virtuous of the two. It took no small
skill for Mr. De Morgan to create such an irresistibly
good woman as Lossie, make his hero in love with
her from boyhood, cause her to marry some one
else, and then to unite the heart-broken hero with
another girl; and through these tremendous upheavals
to make all things work together for good,
and to the reader's complete satisfaction. This
could not possibly have been accomplished had not
the author been able to fashion a woman, who,
while totally unlike Lossie in every physical and
mental aspect, was spiritually even more attractive.
I am not sure which of the two girls has the bigger
place in their maker's heart; I suspect it is Lossie;
but to me Janey is not only a better woman, I really
have a stronger affection for her.</p>

<p>In <i>Alice-for-Short</i>, the hero is again blessed with
two guardian angels, his sister and his second wife.
Mr. De Morgan is extremely generous to his favourite
men, in permitting either their second choice or
their second experiment in matrimony to prove
such an amazing success. Comparatively few novelists
dare to handle the problem of happy second
marriages; the subject for some reason does not
lend itself readily to romance. Josh Billings said
he knew of absolutely nothing that would cure a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
man of laziness; but that a second wife would sometimes
help. Although he said this in the spirit of
farce, it is exactly what happens in Mr. De Morgan's
books. Janey is not technically a second wife,
but she is spiritually; and she rescues Joseph from
despair, restores his ambition and capacity to work,
and after her death is like a guiding star. Alice
is a second wife, both in her husband's heart and in
the law; and her influence on Charles Heath provides
exactly the stimulus needed to save him from
himself. Fenwick marries for the second time,
and although his wife is in one sense the same person,
in another she is not; she is quite different in everything
except constancy from the wretched girl he
left sobbing on the verandah in India. And what
would have become of Fenwick without the mature
Rosalind? Salvation, in Mr. De Morgan's novels,
often assumes a feminine shape. They are not books
of Friendship, like <i>The Cloister and the Hearth</i>, <i>Trilby</i>,
and <i>Es War</i>; with all their wonderful intelligence
and play of intellect, they would seem almost barren
without women. And he is far more successful
in depicting love after marriage than before. One
of the most charming characteristics of these stories
is the frequent representation of the highest happiness
known on earth&mdash;not found in the passion of
early youth, but in a union of two hearts cemented
by joy and sorrow in the experience of years. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
novelist has ever given us better pictures of a good
English home; more attractive glimpses into the
reserveless intimacy of the affairs of the hearth.
The conversations between Christopher Vance and
his wife, between Sir Rupert and Lady Johnson,
between Fenwick and Rosalind, are decidedly superior
to the "love-making" scenes. Indeed, the
description of the walk during which young Dr.
Vereker definitely wins Sally, is disappointing.
It is perhaps the only important episode in Mr.
De Morgan's novels that shows more effort than
inspiration.</p>

<p>The style in these books, despite constant quotation,
is not at all a literary style. Joseph Vance
is called "an ill-written autobiography," because
it lacks entirely the conventional manner. Many
works of fiction are composed in what might be called
the terminology of the art; just as works in science
and in sport are compelled to repeat constantly the
same verbal forms. The astonishing freshness
and charm of Mr. De Morgan's method consist
partly in his abandonment of literary precedent,
and adhering only to actual observation. It is as
though an actor on the stage should suddenly drop
his mannerism of accent and gesture, and behave
as he would were he actually, instead of histrionically,
happy or wretched. Despite the likeness to Dickens
in characters and atmosphere, <i>Joseph Vance</i> sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
not only as though its author had never written a
novel previously, but as though he had never read
one. It has the strangeness of reality. There is
no lack of action in these huge narratives: the men
and women pass through the most thrilling incidents,
and suffer the greatest extremes of passion, pain,
and joy that the human mind can endure. We have
three cases of drowning, one tremendous fire; and
in <i>Somehow Good</i>&mdash;which, viewed merely as a
story, is the best of them&mdash;a highly eventful plot;
and, spiritually, the characters give us an idea of
how much agony the heart can endure without quite
breaking. But though the bare plot seems almost
like melodrama, the style is never on stilts. In the
most awful crises, the language has the absolute
simplicity of actual circumstance. When Rosalind
recognises her husband in the cab, we wonder why
she takes it so coolly. Some sixty pages farther
along, we come upon this paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Nevertheless, these were not so absolute that her demeanour
escaped comment from the cabby, the only witness
of her first sight of the 'electrocuted' man. He spoke of her
afterwards as that squealing party down that sanguinary
little turning off Shepherd's Bush Road he took that sanguinary
galvanic shock to."</p></blockquote>

<p>Our author is fond of presenting events of the most
momentous consequence through the lips of humble
and indifferent observers. It is only the cabman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
chance testimony which shows us that even Rosalind's
superb self-control had the limit determined by real
womanhood; and in <i>Joseph Vance</i>, the great climax
of emotion, when Lossie visits her maligned old
lover, is given with unconscious force through the
faulty vernacular of the "slut" of a servant-maid,
who is utterly unaware of the angels that ministered
over that scene; and then by the broken English
of the German chess-player, equally blind to the
divine presence. Compare these two crude testimonies,
which make the ludicrous blunders made
by the Hostess in that marvellous account of the
death of Falstaff, and you have a veritable harmony
of the Gospels. Some novelists use an extraordinary
style to describe ordinary events; Mr. De
Morgan uses an ordinary style to describe extraordinary
events.</p>

<p>Even in his latest book, <i>It Never Can Happen
Again</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the least cheerful of all his productions,
the title is intended to be as comforting as Charles
Reade's caption, <i>It Is Never Too Late to Mend</i>.
In this story, Mr. De Morgan descends into hell.
Delirium tremens has never been pictured with more
frightful horror than in the awful night when the
mad wretch is bent on murder. No scene in any
naturalistic novel surpasses this in vivid detail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Indeed, all of Mr. De Morgan's books might well
be circulated as anti-alcohol tracts; the real villain
in his tragedies is Drink. Even though drunkenness
in a certain aspect supplies comedy in <i>Joseph Vance</i>,
drink is, after all, the ruin of old Christopher, and we
are left with no shade of doubt that this is so. Mr.
De Morgan's unquestionable optimism does not
blink the dreadful aspects of life, any more than
did Browning's. The scene in the hospital, where
the fingers without finger-nails clasp the mighty
hand in the rubber glove, is as loathsomely horrible
as anything to be found in the annals of disease.
And the career of Blind Jim, entirely ignorant of
his divine origin and destiny, is a series of appalling
calamities. He has lost his sight in a terrible accident;
he is run over by a waggon, and loses his
leg; he is run over by an automobile, and loses his
life. He has also lost, though he does not know it,
what is far dearer to him than eyes, or legs, or life,&mdash;his
little daughter. And yet we do not need
the spirit voice of the dead child to assure us that
all is well. Indeed, the tragic history of Jim and
Lizarann is not nearly so depressing as the humdrum
narrative of the melancholy quarrel between
Mr. and Mrs. Challis. In previous novels, the author
has been pleased to show us domestic happiness;
here we have the dreary round of perpetual discord.
Of course no one can complain of Mr. De Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
for his choice in this matter; it is certainly true that
not all marriages are happy, even though the majority
of them (as I believe) are. The difficulty
is that the triangle in this book&mdash;husband, wife,
and beautiful young lady&mdash;has no corner of real
interest. It is not entirely the fault of either Mr. or
Mrs. Challis that they separate; there is much to
be said on both sides. What we object to is the
fact that it is impossible to sympathise with either
of them; this is not because each is guilty, but
because neither is interesting. We do not much
care what becomes of them. And as for Judith,
the technical virgin who causes all the trouble, she
is a very dull person. We do not need this book
to learn that female beauty without brains fascinates
the ordinary man. The best scenes are those where
Blind Jim and Lizarann appear; they are a couple
fully worthy of Dickens at his best. Unfortunately
they do not appear often enough to suit us, and they
both die. We could more easily have spared Mr.
and Mrs. Challis, the latter's abominable tea-gossip
friend, and that old hypocritical tiger-cat, Mrs.
Challis's mother. Why does Mr. De Morgan make
elderly women so disgustingly unattractive? Does
his sympathy with life desert him here? The entire
Challis household, including the satellites of relationship
and propinquity, are hardly worth the author's
skill or the reader's attention. One would suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that a brilliant novelist, like Challis, pulled from the
domestic orbit by a comet like Judith, would be
for a time in an interesting, if not an edifying, position;
but he is not. Perhaps Mr. De Morgan
wishes to show with the impartiality of a true
chronicler of life that a married man, drawn away
by his own lust, and enticed, can be just as dull in
sin as in virtue. Yet the long dreary family storm
ends in sunshine; the discordant pair are redeemed
by Love,&mdash;the real motive power of this story,&mdash;and
one feels that it can never happen again. In
spite of Mr. De Morgan's continual onslaught on
creeds, Athelstan Taylor, who believes the whole
Apostles' Creed, compares very favourably with
Challis, who believes only the first seven and the
last four words of it, apparently the portion accepted
by Mr. De Morgan: and by their fruits ye shall
know them. It is certainly a proof of the fair-mindedness
of our novelist, that he has created
orthodox believers like Lossie's husband and Athelstan
Taylor, big wholesome fellows, both of them;
and has deliberately made both so irresistibly attractive.
The professional parson is often ridiculed
in modern novels; it is worth noting that in this
story the only important character in the whole
work who combines intelligence with virtue is the
Reverend Athelstan Taylor.
</p>

<p>Seldom have any books shown so intimate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
knowledge of the kingdom of this world and at the
same time reflected with such radiance the kingdom
of heaven. It is noteworthy and encouraging that
a man who portrays with such humorous exactitude
the things that are seen and temporal, should exhibit
so firm a faith in the things that are unseen and
eternal. In <i>Joseph Vance</i> we have the growth of
the soul from an environment of poverty and crime
to the loftiest heights of nobility and self-denial;
and the theme in the Waldstein Sonata triumphantly
repeats the confidence of Dr. Thorpe, who regards
death not as a barrier, but as a gateway. In <i>Alice-for-Short</i>,
the mystery of the spirit-world completely
envelops the humdrum inconsistencies that form
the daily round, the trivial task; this is seen perhaps
not so much in the "ghosts," for they speak of the
past; but the figure of old Verrinder&mdash;whose
heart revolves about the Asylum like the planet
around the sun&mdash;and the waking of old Jane from
her long sleep, seem to symbolise the impotence
of Time to quench the divine spark of Love. This
story is called a "dichronism"; but it might have
been called a <i>dichroism</i>, for from one viewpoint it
reflects only the clouded colour of earth, and from
another a celestial glory. In <i>Somehow Good</i> the
ugliest tragedy takes its place in the unapparent
order of life. It is not that good finally reigns in
spite of evil; the final truth is that in some manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
good is the very goal of ill. The agony of separation
has tested the pure metal of character; and the
fusion of two lives is made permanent in the frightful
heat of awful pain. The fruit of a repulsive
sin may be Beauty, like a flower springing from
a dung-hill. "What became of the baby?...
<i>The</i> baby&mdash;<i>his</i> baby&mdash;<i>his</i> horrible baby!" "Gerry
darling! Gerry <i>dearest</i>! do think...."</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p class="center big">THOMAS HARDY</p>


<p>The father of Thomas Hardy wished his son to
enter the church, and this object was the remote
goal of his early education. At just what period
in the boy's mental development Christianity took
on the form of a meaningless fable, we shall perhaps
never know; but after a time he ceased to have even
the faith of a grain of mustard seed. This absence
of religious belief has proved no obstacle to many
another candidate for the Christian ministry, as
every habitual church-goer knows; or as any son
of Belial may discover for himself by merely reading
the prospectus of summer schools of theology.
There has, however, always been a certain cold,
mathematical precision in Mr. Hardy's way of
thought that would have made him as uncomfortable
in the pulpit as he would have been in an
editor's chair, writing for salary persuasive articles
containing the exact opposite of his individual
convictions. But, although the beauty of holiness
failed to impress his mind, the beauty of the sanctuary
was sufficiently obvious to his sense of Art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
He became an ecclesiastical architect, and for some
years his delight was in the courts of the Lord.
Instead of composing sermons in ink, he made
sermons in stones, restoring to many a decaying
edifice the outlines that the original builder had
seen in his vision centuries ago. For no one has ever
regarded ancient churches with more sympathy
and reverence than Mr. Hardy. No man to-day
has less respect for God and more devotion to His
house.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy's professional career as an architect
extended over a period of about thirteen years, from
the day when the seventeen-year-old boy became
articled, to about 1870, when he forsook the pencil
for the pen. His strict training as an architect has
been of enormous service to him in the construction
of his novels, for skill in constructive drawing has
repeatedly proved its value in literature. Rossetti
achieved positive greatness as an artist and as a
poet. Stevenson's studies in engineering were not
lost time, and Mr. De Morgan affords another
good illustration of the same fact. Thackeray was
unconsciously learning the art of the novelist while
he was making caricatures, and the lesser Thackeray
of a later day&mdash;George du Maurier&mdash;found the
transition from one art to the other a natural progression.
Hopkinson Smith and Frederic Remington,
on a lower but dignified plane, bear witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to the same truth. Indeed, when one studies carefully
the beginnings of the work of imaginative
writers, one is surprised at the great number who
have handled an artist's or a draughtsman's pencil.
A prominent and successful playwright of to-day
has said that if he were not writing plays, he should
not dream of writing books; he would be building
bridges.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy's work as an ecclesiastical architect
laid the real foundations of his success as a novelist;
for it gave him an intimate familiarity with the old
monuments and rural life of Wessex, and at the same
time that eye for precision of form that is so noticeable
in all his books. He has really never ceased
to be an architect. Architecture has contributed
largely to the matter and to the style of his stories.
Two architects appear in his first novel. In <i>A Pair
of Blue Eyes</i> Stephen Smith is a professional architect,
and in coming to restore the old Western
Church he was simply repeating the experience of
his creator. No one of Mr. Hardy's novels contains
more of the facts of his own life than <i>A Laodicean</i>,
which was composed on what the author then believed
to be his death-bed; it was mainly dictated,
which I think partly accounts for its difference in
style from the other tales. The hero, Somerset,
is an architect whose first meeting with his future
wife occurs through his professional curiosity concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the castle; and a considerable portion of
the early chapters is taken up with architectural
detail, and of his enforced rivalry with a competitor
in the scheme for restoration. Not only does Mr.
Hardy's scientific profession speak through the
mouths of his characters, but old and beautiful
buildings adorn his pages as they do the landscape
he loves. In <i>Two on a Tower</i> the ancient structure
appears here and there in the story as naturally and
incidentally as it would to a pedestrian in the neighbourhood;
in <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i> the church tower
plays an important part in a thrilling episode, and its
fall emphasises a Scripture text in a diabolical manner.
The old church at Weatherbury is so closely associated
with the life history of the men and women
in <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> that as one stands
in front of it to-day the people seem to gather again
about its portal....</p>

<p>But while Mr. Hardy has drawn freely on his
knowledge of architecture in furnishing animate
and inanimate material for his novels, the great
results of his youthful training are seen in a more
subtle and profounder influence. The intellectual
delight that we receive in the perusal of his books&mdash;a
delight that sometimes makes us impatient
with the work of feebler authors&mdash;comes largely
from the architectonics of his literary structures.
One never loses sight of Hardy the architect. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
purely constructive skill he has surpassed all his
contemporaries. His novels&mdash;with the exception
of <i>Desperate Remedies</i> and <i>Jude the Obscure</i>&mdash;are
as complete and as beautiful to contemplate as a
sculptor's masterpiece. They are finished and noble
works of art, and give the same kind of pleasure
to the mind as any superbly perfect outline. Mr.
Hardy himself firmly believes that the novel should
first of all be a story: that it should not be a thesis,
nor a collection of reminiscences or <i>obiter dicta</i>.
He insists that a novel should be as much of a whole
as a living organism, where all the parts&mdash;plot,
dialogue, character, and scenery&mdash;should be fitly
framed together, giving the single impression of a
completely harmonious building. One simply cannot
imagine him writing in the manner of a German
novelist, with absolutely no sense of proportion;
nor like the mighty Tolstoi, who steadily sacrifices
Art on the altar of Reality; nor like the great English
school represented by Thackeray, Dickens, Trollope,
and De Morgan, whose charm consists in their intimacy
with the reader; they will interrupt the narrative
constantly to talk it over with the merest bystander,
thus gaining his affection while destroying the illusion.
Mr. Hardy's work shows a sad sincerity, the noble austerity
of the true artist, who feels the dignity of his
art and is quite willing to let it speak for itself.</p>

<p>His earliest novel, <i>Desperate Remedies</i>, is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
like an architect's first crude sketch than a complete
and detailed drawing. Strength, originality, and
a thoroughly intelligent design are perfectly clear;
one feels the impelling mind behind the product.
But it resembles the <i>plan</i> of a good novel rather
than a novel itself. The lines are hard; there is
a curious rigidity about the movement of the plot
which proceeds in jerks, like a machine that requires
frequent winding up. The manuscript was submitted
to a publishing firm, who, it is interesting
to remember, handed it over to their professional
reader, George Meredith. Mr. Meredith told the
young author that his work was promising; and he
said it in such a way that the two men became life-long
friends, there being no more jealousy between
them than existed between Tennyson and Browning.
Years later Mr. Meredith said that he regarded Mr.
Hardy as the real leader of contemporary English
novelists; and the younger man always maintained
toward his literary adviser an attitude of sincere
reverence, of which his poem on the octogenarian's
death was a beautiful expression. There is something
fine in the honest friendship and mutual
admiration of two giants, who cordially recognise
each other above the heads of the crowd, and who
are themselves placidly unmoved by the fierce
jealousy of their partisans. In this instance, despite
a total unlikeness in literary style, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
genuine intellectual kinship. Mr. Meredith and
Mr. Hardy were both Pagans and regarded the world
and men and women from the Pagan standpoint,
though the deduction in one case was optimism
and in the other pessimism. Given the premises,
the younger writer's conclusions seem more logical;
and the processes of his mind were always more
orderly than those of his brilliant and irregular
senior. There is little doubt (I think) as to which
of the two should rank higher in the history of English
fiction, where fineness of Art surely counts for something.
Mr. Hardy is a great novelist; whereas to
adapt a phrase that Arnold applied to Emerson, I
should say that Mr. Meredith was not a great novelist;
he was a great man who wrote novels.</p>

<p>Immediately after the publication of <i>Desperate
Remedies</i>, which seemed to teach him, as <i>Endymion</i>
taught Keats, the highest mysteries of his art, Mr.
Hardy entered upon a period of brilliant and splendid
production. In three successive years, 1872, 1873,
and 1874, he produced three masterpieces&mdash;<i>Under
the Greenwood Tree</i>, <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i>, and <i>Far
from the Madding Crowd</i>; followed four years
later by what is, perhaps, his greatest contribution
to literature, <i>The Return of the Native</i>. Even in
literary careers that last a long time, there seem to
be golden days when the inspiration is unbalked by
obstacles. It is interesting to contemplate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
lengthy row of Scott's novels, and then to remember
that <i>The Heart of Midlothian</i>, <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>
and <i>Ivanhoe</i> were published in three successive
years; to recall that the same brief span
covered in George Eliot's work the production of
<i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>, <i>Adam Bede</i>, and <i>The Mill
on the Floss</i>; and one has only to compare what
Mr. Kipling accomplished in 1888, 1889, and 1890
with any other triennial, to discover when he had
what the Methodists call "liberty." Mr. Hardy's
career as a writer has covered about forty years;
omitting his collections of short tales, he has written
fourteen novels; from 1870 to 1880, inclusive, seven
appeared; from 1881 to 1891, five; from 1892 to
1902, two; since 1897 he has published no novels
at all. With that singular and unfortunate perversity
which makes authors proudest of their lamest
offspring, Mr. Hardy has apparently abandoned the
novel for poetry and the poetic drama. I suspect
that praise of his verse is sweeter to him than
praise of his fiction; but, although his poems are
interesting for their ideas, and although we all like
the huge <i>Dynasts</i> better than we did when we first
saw it, it is a great pity from the economic point of
view that the one man who can write novels better
than anybody else in the same language should deliberately
choose to write something else in which
he is at his very best only second rate. The world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
suffers the same kind of economic loss (less only in
degree) that it suffered when Milton spent twenty
years of his life in writing prose; and when Tolstoi
forsook novels for theology.</p>

<p>It is probable that one reason why Mr. Hardy
quit novel-writing was the hostile reception that
greeted <i>Jude the Obscure</i>. Every great author,
except Tennyson, has been able to endure adverse
criticism, whether he hits back, like Pope and Byron,
or whether he proceeds on his way in silence. But
no one has ever enjoyed or ever will enjoy misrepresentation;
and there is no doubt that the writer
of <i>Jude</i> felt that he had been cruelly misunderstood.
It is, I think, the worst novel he has ever written,
both from the moral and from the artistic point of
view; but the novelist was just as sincere in his
intention as when he wrote the earlier books. The
difficulty is that something of the same change
had taken place in his work that is so noticeable in
that of Björnson; he had ceased to be a pure artist
and had become a propagandist. The fault that
marred the splendid novel <i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i>
ruined <i>Jude the Obscure</i>. When Mr. Hardy wrote
on the title-page of <i>Tess</i> the words, "A Pure Woman
Faithfully Presented," he issued defiantly the name
of a thesis which the story (great, in spite of this)
was intended to defend. To a certain extent, his
interest in the argument blinded his artistic sense;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
otherwise he would never have committed the error
of hanging his heroine. The mere hanging of a
heroine may not be in itself an artistic blunder,
for Shakespeare hanged Cordelia. But Mr. Hardy
executed Tess because he was bound to see his thesis
through. In the prefaces to subsequent editions the
author turned on his critics, calling them "sworn
discouragers of effort," a phrase that no doubt
some of them deserved; and then, like many another
man who believes in himself, he punished both
critics and the public in the Rehoboam method by
issuing <i>Jude the Obscure</i>. Instead of being a masterpiece
of despair, like <i>The Return of the Native</i>, this
book is a shriek of rage. Pessimism, which had been
a noble ground quality of his earlier writings, is
in <i>Jude</i> merely hysterical and wholly unconvincing.
The author takes obvious pains to make things come
out wrong; as in melodramas and childish romances,
the law of causation is suspended in the interest of
the hero's welfare. Animalism, which had partially
disfigured <i>Tess</i>, became gross and revolting in <i>Jude</i>;
and the representation of marriage and the relations
between men and women, instead of being a picture
of life, resembled a caricature. It is a matter of
sincere regret that Mr. Hardy has stopped novel-writing,
but we want no more <i>Judes</i>. Didactic
pessimism is not good for the novel.</p>

<p><i>The Well-Beloved</i>, published in 1897, but really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
a revision of an earlier tale, is in a way a triumph
of Art. The plot is simply absurd, almost as whimsical
as anything in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. A man
proposes to a young girl and is rejected; when her
daughter is grown, he proposes to the representative
of the second generation, and with the same ill fortune.
When <i>her</i> daughter reaches maturity, he tries the
third woman in line and without success. His
perseverance was equalled only by his bad luck,
as so often happens in Mr. Hardy's stories. And
yet, with a plot that would wreck any other novelist,
the author constructed a powerful and beautifully
written novel. It is as though the architect had
taken a wretched plan and yet somehow contrived
to erect on its false lines a handsome building.
The book has naturally added nothing to his reputation,
but as a <i>tour de force</i> it is hard to surpass.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to remember that a man's opinion
of his own work has nothing to do with its final
success and that his best creations cannot be injured
by his worst. Tolstoi may be ashamed of having
written <i>Anna Karenina</i>, and may insist that his
sociological tracts are superior productions, but we
know better; and rejoice in his powerlessness to
efface his own masterpieces. We may honestly
think that we should be ashamed to put our own
names to such stuff as <i>Little Dorrit</i>, but that does not
prevent us from admiring the splendid genius that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
produced <i>David Copperfield</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i>.
Mr. Hardy may believe that <i>Jude the Obscure</i> represents
his zenith as a novelist, and that his poems
are still greater literature; but one reading of <i>Jude</i>
suffices, while we never tire of rereading <i>Far from
the Madding Crowd</i> and <i>The Return of the Native</i>.
Probably no publisher's announcement in the world
to-day would cause more pleasure to English-speaking
people than the announcement that Thomas
Hardy was at work on a Wessex novel with characters
of the familiar kind.</p>

<p>For <i>The Dynasts</i>, which covers the map of Europe,
transcends the sky, and deals with world-conquerors,
is not nearly so great a world-drama as
<i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i>, that is circumscribed in a small
corner of a small island, and treats exclusively of
a little group of commonplace persons. Literature
deals with a constant&mdash;human nature, which is the
same in Wessex as in Vienna. As the late Mr.
Clyde Fitch used to say, it is not the great writers
that have great things happen to them; the great
things happen to the ordinary people they portray.
Mr. Hardy selected a few of the southwestern
counties of England as the stage for his prose dramas;
to this locality he for the first time, in <i>Far from the
Madding Crowd</i>, gave the name Wessex, a name
now wholly fictitious, but which his creative imagination
has made so real that it is constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and seriously spoken of as though it were English
geography. In these smiling valleys and quiet
rural scenes, "while the earth keeps up her terrible
composure," the farmers and milkmaids hold us
spellbound as they struggle in awful passion. The
author of the drama stands aloof, making no effort
to guide his characters from temptation, folly, and
disaster, and offering no explanation to the spectators,
who are thrilled with pity and fear. But one feels
that he loves and hates his children as we do, and
that he correctly gauges their moral value. The
very narrowness of the scene increases the intensity
of the play. The rustic cackle of his bourg drowns
the murmur of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy's knowledge of and sympathy with
nature is of course obvious to all readers, but it is
none the less impressive as we once more open
books that we have read many times. There are
incidentally few novelists who repay one so richly
for repeated perusals. He seems as inexhaustible
as nature herself, and he grows stale no faster than
the repetition of the seasons. It is perhaps rather
curious that a man who finds nature so absolutely
inexorable and indifferent to human suffering should
love her so well. But every man must love something
greater than himself, and as Mr. Hardy had
no God, he has drawn close to the world of trees,
plains, and rivers. His intimacy with nature is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
almost uncanny. Nature is not merely a background
in his stories, it is often an active agent.
There are striking characters in <i>The Return of the
Native</i>, but the greatest character in the book is
Egdon Heath. The opening chapter, which gives
the famous picture of the Heath, is like an overture
to a great music-drama. The <i>Heath-motif</i> is repeated
again and again in the story. It has a personality
of its own, and affects the fortunes and the
hearts of all human beings who dwell in its proximity.
If one stands to-day on the edge of this Heath at
the twilight hour, just at the moment when Darkness
is conquering Light&mdash;the moment chosen
by Mr. Hardy for the first chapter&mdash;one realises
its significance and its possibilities. In <i>Tess of the
D'Urbervilles</i> the intercourse between man and
nature is set forth with amazing power. The different
seasons act as chorus to the human tragedy.
In <i>The Woodlanders</i> the trees seem like separate
individualities. To me a tree has become a different
thing since I first read this particular novel.</p>

<p>Even before he took up the study of architecture,
Mr. Hardy's unconscious training as a novelist
began. When he was a small boy, the Dorchester
girls found him useful in a way that recalls the
services of that reliable child, Samuel Richardson.
These village maids, in their various love-affairs,
which necessitated a large amount of private correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
employed young Hardy as amanuensis.
He did not, like his great predecessor, compose their
epistles; but he held the pen, and faithfully recorded
the inspiration of Love, as it flowed warm
from the lips of passionate youth. In this manner,
the almost sexless boy was enabled to look clear-eyed
into the very heart of palpitating young womanhood,
and to express accurately its most gentle and most
stormy emotions; just as the white voice of a choir-child
repeats with precision the thrilling notes of
religious passion. These early experiences were undoubtedly
of the highest value in later years; indeed,
as the boy grew a little older, it is probable that the
impression deepened. Mr. Hardy is fond of depicting
the vague, half-conscious longing of a boy
to be near a beautiful woman; everyone will remember
the contract between Eustacia and her
youthful admirer, by which he was to hold her hand
for a stipulated number of minutes. Mr. Hardy's
women are full of tenderness and full of caprice;
and whatever feminine readers may think of them,
they are usually irresistible to the masculine mind.
It has been said, indeed, that he is primarily a man's
novelist, as Mrs. Ward is perhaps a woman's; he
does not represent his women as marvels of intellectual
splendour, or in queenly domination over the
society in which they move. They are more apt to
be the victims of their own affectionate hearts. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
female reader, exasperated at this succession of
portraits, wrote on the margin of one of Mr. Hardy's
novels that she took from a circulating library, "Oh,
how I <i>hate</i> Thomas Hardy!" This is an interesting
gloss, even if we do not add meanly that it bears
witness to the truth of the picture. Elfride, Bathsheba,
Eustacia, Lady Constantine, Marty South,
and Tess are of varied social rank and wealth; but
they are all alike in humble prostration before the
man they love. Mr. Hardy takes particular pleasure
in representing them as swayed by sudden and constantly
changing caprices; one has only to recall
the charming Bathsheba Everdene, and her various
attitudes toward the three men who admire her&mdash;Troy,
Boldwood, and Gabriel Oak. Mr. Hardy's
heroines change their minds oftener than they change
their clothes; but in whatever material or mental
presentment, they never lack attraction. And they
all resemble their maker in one respect; at heart
every one of them is a Pagan. They vary greatly
in constancy and in general strength of character;
but it is human passion, and not religion, that is the
mainspring of their lives. He has never drawn a
truly spiritual woman, like Browning's Pompilia.</p>

<p>His best men, from the moral point of view, are
closest to the soil. Gabriel Oak, in <i>Far from the
Madding Crowd</i>, and Venn, in <i>The Return of the
Native</i>, are, on the whole, his noblest characters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Oak is a shepherd and Venn is a reddleman; their
sincerity, charity, and fine sense of honour have never
been injured by what is called polite society. And
Mr. Hardy, the stingiest author toward his characters,
has not entirely withheld reward from these
two. Henry Knight and Angel Clare, who have
whatever advantages civilisation is supposed to
give, are certainly not villains; they are men of the
loftiest ideals; but if each had been a deliberate
black-hearted villain, he could not have treated the
innocent woman who loved him with more ugly
cruelty. Compared with Oak and Venn, this
precious pair of prigs are seen to have only the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees; a righteousness
that is of little help in the cruel emergencies
of life. Along with them must stand Clym Yeobright,
another slave to moral theory, who quite
naturally ends his days as an itinerant preacher.
The real villains in Mr. Hardy's novels, Sergeant
Troy, young Dare, and Alec D'Urberville, seem the
least natural and the most machine-made of all
his characters.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy's pessimism is a picturesque and splendid
contribution to modern fiction. We should be
as grateful for it in this field as we are to Schopenhauer
in the domain of metaphysics. I am no pessimist
myself, but I had rather read Schopenhauer
than all the rest of the philosophers put together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Plato alone excepted. The pessimism of Mr.
Hardy resembles that of Schopenhauer in being
absolutely thorough and absolutely candid; it
makes the world as darkly superb and as terribly
interesting as a Greek drama. It is wholly worth
while to get this point of view; and if in practical
life one does not really believe in it, it is capable of
yielding much pleasure. After finishing one of
Mr. Hardy's novels, one has all the delight of waking
from an impressive but horrible dream, and feeling
through the dissolving vision the real friendliness
of the good old earth. It is like coming home from
an adequate performance of <i>King Lear</i>, which we
would not have missed for anything. There are
so many make-believe pessimists, so many whose
pessimism is a sham and a pose, which will not stand
for a moment in a real crisis, that we cannot withhold
admiration for such pessimism as Mr. Hardy's,
which is fundamental and sincere. To him the
Christian religion and what we call the grace of God
have not the slightest shade of meaning; he is as
absolute a Pagan as though he had written four
thousand years before Christ. This is something
almost refreshing, because it is so entirely different
from the hypocrisy and cant, the pretence of pessimism,
so familiar to us in the works of modern
writers; and so inconsistent with their daily life.
Mr. Hardy's pessimism is the one deep-seated conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of his whole intellectual process.</p>

<p>I once saw a print of a cartoon drawn by a contemporary
Dresden artist, Herr Sascha Schneider.
It was called "The Helplessness of Man against
Destiny." We see a quite naked man, standing
with his back to us; his head is bowed in hopeless
resignation; heavy manacles are about his wrists,
to which chains are attached, that lead to some
fastening in the ground. Directly before him, with
hideous hands, that now almost entirely surround
the little circle where he stands in dejection, crawls
flatly toward him a prodigious, shapeless monster,
with his horrid narrow eyes fixed on his defenceless
human prey. And the man is so conscious of his
tether, that even in the very presence of the unspeakably
awful object, <i>the chains hang loose</i>! He may
have tried them once, but he has since given up.
The monster is Destiny; and the real meaning of
the picture is seen in the eyes, nose, and mouth of
the loathsome beast. There is not only no sympathy
and no intelligence there; there is an expression
far more terrible than the evident lust to devour;
there is plainly the <i>sense of humour</i> shown on this
hideous face. The contrast between the limitless
strength of the monster and the utter weakness of
the man, flavours the stupidity of Destiny with the
zest of humour.</p>

<p>Now this is a correct picture of life as Mr. Hardy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
sees it. His God is a kind of insane child, who
cackles foolishly as he destroys the most precious
objects. Some years ago I met a man entirely
blind. He said that early in life he had lost the
sight of one eye by an accident; and that years later,
as he held a little child on his lap, the infant, in rare
good humour, playfully poked the point of a pair
of scissors into the other, thus destroying his sight
for ever. So long an interval had elapsed since this
second and final catastrophe, that the man spoke
of it without the slightest excitement or resentment.
The child with the scissors might well represent
Hardy's conception of God. Destiny is whimsical,
rather than definitely malicious; for Destiny has
not sufficient intelligence even to be systematically
bad. We smile at Caliban's natural theology, as
he composes his treatise on Setebos; but his God
is the same who disposes of man's proposals in the
stories of our novelist.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2q">"In which feat, if his leg snapped, brittle clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he lay stupid-like,&mdash;why, I should laugh;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">'Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in Him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor kind, nor cruel: He is strong and Lord."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Hardy believes that, morally, men and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
are immensely superior to God; for all the good
qualities that we attribute to Him in prayer are
human, not divine. He in his loneliness is totally
devoid of the sense of right and wrong, and knows
neither justice nor mercy. His poem <i>New Year's
Eve</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> clearly expresses his theology.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy's pessimism is not in the least personal,
nor has it risen from any sorrow or disappointment
in his own life. It is both philosophic and temperamental.
He cannot see nature in any other
way. To venture a guess, I think his pessimism is
mainly caused by his deep, manly tenderness for
all forms of human and animal life and by an almost
abnormal sympathy. His intense love for bird and
beast is well known; many a stray cat and hurt
dog have found in him a protector and a refuge.
He firmly believes that the sport of shooting is wicked,
and he has repeatedly joined in practical measures
to waken the public conscience on this subject.
As a spectator of human history, he sees life as a
vast tragedy, with men and women emerging from
nothingness, suffering acute physical and mental
sorrow, and then passing into nothingness again.
To his sympathetic mind, the creed of optimism
is a ribald insult to the pain of humanity and devout
piety merely absurd. To hear these suffering men
and women utter prayers of devotion and sing hymns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of adoration to the Power whence comes all their
anguish is to him a veritable abdication of reason
and common sense. God simply does not deserve
it, and he for one will have the courage to say so.
He will not stand by and see humanity submit so
tamely to so heartless a tyrant. For, although Mr.
Hardy is a pessimist, he has not the least tincture
of cynicism. If one analyses his novels carefully,
one will see that he seldom shows scorn for his
characters; his contempt is almost exclusively devoted
to God. Sometimes the evil fate that his
characters suffer is caused by the very composition
of their mind, as is seen in <i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i>;
again it is no positive human agency, but rather an
Æschylean conception of hidden forces, as in <i>The
Return of the Native</i>; but in neither case is humanity
to blame.</p>

<p>This pessimism has one curious effect that adds
greatly to the reader's interest when he takes up an
hitherto unread novel by our author. The majority
of works of fiction end happily; indeed, many are
so badly written that any ending cannot be considered
unfortunate. But with most novelists we
have a sense of security. We know that, no matter
what difficulties the hero and heroine may encounter,
the unseen hand of their maker will guide them
eventually to paths of pleasantness and peace. Mr.
Hardy inspires no such confidence. In reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Trollope, one smiles at a cloud of danger, knowing
it will soon pass over; but after reading <i>A Pair of
Blue Eyes</i>, or <i>Tess</i>, one follows the fortunes of young
Somerset in <i>A Laodicean</i> with constant fluctuation of
faint hope and real terror; for we know that with
Mr. Hardy the worst may happen at any moment.</p>

<p>However dark may be his conception of life, Mr.
Hardy's sense of humour is unexcelled by his contemporaries
in its subtlety of feeling and charm of
expression. His rustics, who have long received
and deserved the epithet "Shakespearian," arouse
in every reader harmless and wholesome delight.
The shadow of the tragedy lifts in these wonderful
pages, for Mr. Hardy's laughter reminds one of
what Carlyle said of Shakespeare's: it is like sunshine
on the deep sea. The childlike sincerity of
these shepherd farmers, the candour of their repartee
and their appraisal of gentle-folk are as irresistible
as their patience and equable temper. Everyone
in the community seems to find his proper
mental and moral level. And their infrequent fits
of irritation are as pleasant as their more solemn
moods. We can all sympathise (I hope) with the
despair of Joseph Poorgrass: "I was sitting at home
looking for Ephesians and says I to myself, 'Tis
nothing but Corinthians and Thessalonians in this
danged Testament!"</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p class="center big">WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS</p>


<p>Born in a little village in Ohio over seventy years
ago, and growing up with small Latin and less Greek,
Mr. Howells may fairly be called a self-educated
man. Just why the epithet "self-made" should
be applied to those non-college-graduates who
succeed in business, and withheld from those who
succeed in poetry and fiction, seems not entirely
clear. Perhaps it is tacitly assumed that those who
become captains of industry achieve prominence
without divine assistance; whereas men of letters,
with or without early advantages, and whether
grateful or not, have unconscious communication
with hidden forces. Be this as it may, the boy
Howells had little schooling and no college. All
the public institutions in the world, however, are
but a poor makeshift in the absence of good home
training; and the future novelist's father was the
right sort of man and had the right sort of occupation
to stimulate a clever and ambitious son. The
elder Howells was the editor of a country newspaper,
which, like a country doctor, makes up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
variety of information what it loses in spread of
influence. The boy was a compositor before he
was a composer, as plenty of literary men since
Richardson have been; he helped to set up lyrics,
news items, local gossip, the funny column, and
patent medicine advertisements. From mechanical
he passed to original work, both in his father's
office and in other sanctums about the state; sometimes
acting not only as contributor, but "moulding
public opinion" from the editor's chair. And
indeed he has never entirely stepped out of the
editorial rôle. During an amazingly busy life as
novelist, dramatist, poet, and foreign diplomat,
Mr. Howells has acted as editorial writer on the
<i>Nation</i>, the <i>Atlantic</i>, the <i>Cosmopolitan Magazine</i>,
and <i>Harper's Monthly</i>. I think he would sometimes
be appalled at the prodigious amount of
merely "timely" articles that he has written, were
it not for the fact that during his long career he has
never published a single line of which he need feel
ashamed.</p>

<p>Type-setters and printers are commonly men of
ideas, who have interesting minds, and are good to
talk with. Mr. Howells was certainly no exception
to the rule, and to the foundation of his early education
as a compositor and journalist he added four
years of study of the Italian language and literature
in the pleasant environment of Venice. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
always been a man of peace; and it is interesting
to remember that during the four years of tumultuous
and bloody civil war, Mr. Howells was serving his
country as a United States Consul in Italy, and at
the same time preparing to add to the kind of fame
she most sorely needs. The "woman-country"
never meant to him what it signified to Browning;
but it has always been an inspiration, and he would
have been a different person without this foreign
influence. Besides some critical and scholarly
works on Italian literature, much of his subsequent
writing has been done beyond the Alps, and the
plot of one of his foremost novels develops on the
streets of Florence. And in another and wholly
delightful story, we have the keen pleasure of seeing
Italian life and society through the eyes of Lydia
Blood.</p>

<p>He formally began a literary career by the composition
of a volume of poems, as Blackmore, Hardy,
Meredith, and many other novelists have seen fit
to do. He is not widely known as a poet to-day,
though all his life he has written more or less verse
without achieving distinction; for he is essentially
a <i>prosateur</i>. In 1872, twelve years after the appearance
of his book of poems, came his first successful
novel, <i>Their Wedding Journey</i>. This story
is written in the style that is responsible for its
author's fame and popularity; it is thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
typical of the whole first part of his novel-production.
It has that quiet stingless humour, clever dialogue,
and wholesome charm, that all readers of Mr.
Howells associate with his name. In other words,
it is a clear manifestation of his own personality.
Now as to the permanent value and final place in
literature of these American novels, critics may
differ; but there can be only one opinion of the man
who wrote them.</p>

<p>The personality of Mr. Howells, as shown both
in his objective novels and in his subjective literary
confessions, is one that irresistibly commands our
highest respect and our warmest affection. A
simple, democratic, unaffected, modest, kindly,
humorous, healthy soul, with a rare combination
of rugged virility and extreme refinement. It is
exceedingly fortunate for America that such a man
has for so many years by common consent, at home
and abroad, been regarded as the Dean of American
Letters. He has had more influence on the output
of fiction in America than any other living man.
This influence has been entirely wholesome, from
the standpoint of both morals and Art. He has
consistently stood for Reticent Realism. He has
ridiculed what he is fond of calling "romantic rot,"
and his own novels have been a silent but emphatic
protest against "mentioning the unmentionable."
Every now and then there has risen a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
violent revolt against his leadership, the latest outspoken
attack coming from a novelist of distinction,
Gertrude Atherton. In the year 1907 she relieved
her mind by declaring that Mr. Howells has been
and is a writer for boarding-school misses; that he
has never penetrated deeply into life; and that not
only has his own timidity prevented him from
courageously revealing the hearts of men and women,
but that his position of power and influence has
cast a blight on American fiction. Thanks to him,
she insists, American novels are pale and colourless
productions, and are known the world over for their
tameness and insipidity. Mrs. Atherton has been
supported in this revolt by many very young literary
aspirants, who lack her wisdom and her experience,
and whose chief dislike of Mr. Howells, when finally
analysed, seems to be directed against his intense
ethical earnestness. For, at heart, Mr. Howells
resembles most Anglo-Saxon novelists in being a
moralist.</p>

<p>It is true that American novelists and playwrights
are at one great disadvantage as compared with
contemporary Continental writers. Owing to the
public conscience, they are compelled to work in a
limited field. The things that we leave to medical
specialists and to alienists are staple subject-matter
in high-class French and German fiction. In a
European dictionary there is no such word as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
"reserve." French writers like Brieux protest
that American conceptions of French morals are
based on the reading of French books whose authors
have no standing in Paris, and whose very names
are unknown to their countrymen. But this protest
fades before facts. The facts are that Parisian
novelists and dramatists of the highest literary and
social distinction, who are awarded national prizes,
admitted to the French Academy, and who receive
all sorts of public honours, write and publish books,
which, if produced in the United States by an
American, would bar him from the houses and
from the society of many decent people, and might
cause his arrest. At any rate, he would be regarded
as a criminal rather than as a hero. I have
in mind plays by Donnay, recently elected to the
French Academy; plays by Capus, who stands
high in public regard; novels by Regnier, who has
received all sorts of honours. These men are certainly
not fourth- and fifth-class writers; they are
thoroughly representative of Parisian literary taste.
Regnier has not hesitated to write, and the editors
have not hesitated to accept, for the periodical
<i>L'Illustration</i>, which goes into family circles everywhere,
a novel that could not possibly be published
in any respectable magazine in America. I do not
say that Americans are one peg higher in morality
than Frenchmen; it may be that we are hypocrites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and that the French are models of virtue; but the
difference in moral tone between the average American
play or novel and that produced in Paris is
simply enormous.</p>

<p>The modern German novel is no better than the
French. Last night I finished reading Sudermann's
long and powerful story, <i>Das hohe Lied</i>. I could
not help thinking how entirely different it is in its
subject-matter, in its characters, in its scenes, and
in its atmosphere, from the average American novel.
Now of course the subject that arouses the most
instant interest from all classes of people, both
young and old, innocent and guilty, is the subject
of sex. A large number of modern successful
French and German novels and plays contain no
other matter of any real importance&mdash;and would
be intolerably dull were it not for their dealing with
sexual crimes. The Continental writer is barred
by no restraint; when he has nothing to say, as
is very often the case, he simply plays his trump
card. The American, however, is not permitted
to penetrate beyond the bounds of decency; which
shuts him off from the chief field where European
writers dwell. He must somehow make his novel
interesting to his readers, just as a man is expected
to make himself interesting in social conversation,
without recourse to pruriency or obscenity.</p>

<p>Leaving out of debate for a moment the moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
aspect of Art, is it necessarily true that novels which
plunge freely into sex questions are a more faithful
representation of life than those that observe the
limits of good taste? I think not. The men and
women in many Continental stories have apparently
nothing to do except to gratify their passions. All
the thousand and one details that make up the
daily routine of the average person are sacrificed
to emphasise one thing; but this, even in most
degraded Sybarites, would be only a part of their
actual activity. I believe that <i>A Modern Instance</i>
is just as true to life as <i>Bel-Ami</i>. It would really
be a misfortune if Mrs. Atherton could have her
way; for then American novelists would copy the
faults of European writers instead of their virtues.
The reason why French plays and French novels
are generally superior to American is not because
they are indecent; and we shall never raise our
standard merely by copying foreign immorality.
The superiority of the French is an intellectual
and artistic superiority; they excel us in literary
style. If we are to imitate them, let us imitate their
virtues and not their defects, even though the task
in this case be infinitely more difficult.</p>

<p>And, granting what Mrs. Atherton says, that the
reticence of American fiction is owing largely to
the influence of Mr. Howells, have we not every
reason to be grateful to him? Has not the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
novel a tremendous influence in education, and do
we really wish to see young men and women, boys
and girls, reading stories that deal mainly with sex?
Is it well that they should abandon Dickens, Thackeray,
and Stevenson, for the novel in vogue on the
Continent? It is often said that French fiction
is intended only for seasoned readers, and is carefully
kept from youth. But this is gammon, and
should deceive only the grossly ignorant. As if
anything nowadays could be kept from youth!
With the exception of girls who are very strictly
brought up, young people in Europe have the utmost
freedom in reading. In one of Regnier's novels,
which purports to be autobiographical, the favourite
bedside book of the boy in his teens is <i>Mademoiselle
de Maupin</i>. In a secret ballot vote recently taken
by a Russian periodical, to discover who are the
most popular novelists with high-school boys and
girls in Russia, it appeared that of all foreign writers
Guy de Maupassant stood first. Is this really a
desirable state of affairs? Suppose it be true, as it
probably is, that the average Russian, German, or
French boy of seventeen is intellectually more mature
than his English or American contemporary&mdash;are
we willing to make the physical and moral
sacrifice for the merely mental advance? Is it
not better that our boys should be playing football
and reading <i>Treasure Island</i>, than that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
be spending their leisure hours in the manner described
by Regnier?</p>

<p>Mr. Howells's creed in Art is perhaps more open
to criticism than his creed in Ethics. His artistic
creed is narrow, strict, and definite. He has expressed
it in his essays, and exemplified it in his
novels. His two doctrinal works, <i>Criticism and
Fiction</i>, and <i>My Literary Passions</i>, resemble Zola's
<i>Le Roman Expérimental</i> in dogmatic limitation.
The creed of Mr. Howells is realism, which he has
not only faithfully followed in his creative work,
but which he uses as a standard by which to measure
the value of other novelists, both living and dead.
As genius always refuses to be measured by any
standard, and usually defies classification, Mr.
Howells's literary estimates of other men's work
are far more valuable as self-revelation than as
adequate appraisal. Indeed, some of his criticisms
seem bizarre. Where works of fiction do not run
counter to his literary dogmas, he is abundantly
sympathetic and more than generous; many a
struggling young writer has cause to bless him for
powerful assistance; apparently there has never
been one grain of envy, jealousy, or meanness in the
mind of our American dean. But, broadly speaking,
Mr. Howells has not the true critical mind, which
places itself for the moment in the mental attitude
of the author criticised; he is primarily a creative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
rather than a critical writer. Here he is in curious
opposition to his friend and contemporary, Henry
James. Mr. James is a natural-born critic, one of
the best America has ever produced. His essay on
Balzac was a masterpiece. His intellectual power
is far more critical than creative; as a novelist, he
seems quite inferior to Mr. Howells. And his best
story, the little sketch, <i>Daisy Miller</i>, was properly
called by its author a "study."</p>

<p>Mr. Howells's literary career has two rather
definite periods. The break was caused largely
by the influence of Tolstoi. The earlier novels
are more purely artistic; they are accurate representations
of American characters, for the most
part joyous in mood, full of genuine humour, and
natural charm. A story absolutely expressive of
the author as we used to know him is <i>The Lady
of the Aroostook</i>. As a sympathetic and delightful
portrayal of a New England country girl, this book
is one of his best productions. The voyage across
the Atlantic; the surprise caused by Lydia's name
and appearance, and homely conversation. "I
want to know!" cried Lydia. The second surprise
caused by her splendid singing voice. The third
surprise caused to the sophisticated young gentleman
by discovering that he was in love with her.
His rapture at his glorious good-fortune in saving
the drunken wretch from drowning, thus acting as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
hero before his lady's eyes; her virginal experiences
in Italy; the final happy consummation&mdash;all this
is in Mr. Howells's best vein, the Howells of thirty
years ago. The story is full of observation, cerebration,
and human affection. As Professor Beers
has remarked, if Mr. Howells knows his countrymen
no more intimately than does Henry James,
at least he loves them better. This charming novel
was rapidly followed in the next few years by a
succession of books that are at once good to read,
and of permanent value as reflections of American
life, manners, and morals. These were <i>A Modern
Instance</i>, <i>A Woman's Reason</i>, <i>The Rise of Silas
Lapham</i>, and <i>Indian Summer</i>; making a literary
harvest of which not only their author, but all Americans,
have reason to be justly proud.</p>

<p>Somewhere along in the eighties Mr. Howells
came fully within the grasp of the mighty influence
of Tolstoi, an influence, which, no matter how
beneficial in certain ways, has not been an unmixed
blessing on his foreign disciples. What the American
owes to the great Russian, and how warm is
his gratitude therefor, any one may see for himself
by reading <i>My Literary Passions</i>. It is indeed
difficult to praise the maker of <i>Anna Karenina</i> too
highly; but nobody wanted Mr. Howells to become
a lesser Tolstoi. When we wish to read Tolstoi,
we know where to find him; we wish Mr. Howells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to remain his own self, shrewdly observant, and
kindly humorous. The latter novels of the American
show the same kind of change that took place
in Björnson, that has also characterised Bourget;
it is the partial abandonment of the novel as an art
form, and its employment as a social, political,
or religious tract. Mr. Howells's saving sense of
humour has kept him from dull extremes; but when
<i>A Hazard of New Fortunes</i> appeared, we knew
that there was more in the title than the writer intended;
our old friend had put on Saul's armour.
As has been suggested above, this change was not
entirely an individual one; it was symptomatic of
the development of the modern novel all over the
world. But in this instance it seemed particularly
regrettable. We have our fill of strikes and labour
troubles in the daily newspaper, without going to
our novelist for them. With one exception, it is
probable that not a single one of Mr. Howells's
novels published during the last twenty years is as
good, from the artistic and literary point of view, as
the admirable work he produced before 1889. The
exception is <i>The Kentons</i> (1902), in which he returned
to his earlier manner, in a triumphant way
that showed he had not lost his skill. Indeed, there
is no trace of decay in the other books of his late
years; there is merely a loss of charm.</p>

<p>I think that <i>Indian Summer</i>, despite its immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
popularity at the time of publication, has never
received the high praise it really deserves. It is
written in a positive glow of artistic creation. I
believe that of all its author's works, it is the one
whose composition he most keenly enjoyed. The
conversations&mdash;always a great feature of his stories&mdash;are
immensely clever; I suspect that as he wrote
them he was often agreeably surprised at his own
inspiration. The three characters, the middle-aged
man and woman, and the romantic young
girl, are admirably set off; no one has ever better
shown the fact that it is quite possible for one to
imagine oneself in love when really one is fancy-free.
The delicate shades of jealousy in the intimate
talks between the two women are exquisitely
done; the experience of the grown woman contrasting
finely with the imagination of the young girl.
The difference between a man of forty and a woman
of twenty, shown here not in heavy tragedy, but in
the innumerable, convincing details of daily human
intercourse, is finely emphasised; and we can feel
the great relief of both when the engagement tie
is broken. This story in its way is a masterpiece;
and anyone who lacks enthusiasm for its author
ought to read it again.</p>

<p>His most powerful novel is probably <i>A Modern
Instance</i>. This, like many American and English
fictions, first appeared in serial form&mdash;a fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
should be known before one indulges in criticism.
The old objection to this method was that it led the
writer to attempt to end each section dramatically,
leaving the reader with a sharp appetite for more.
The movement of the narrative, when the book was
finally published as a whole, resembled a series of
jumps. Someone has said, that even so fine a
novel as <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> was a succession
of brilliant leaps; whether or not this was
caused by its original serial printing, I do not know.
This difficulty would never appear in Mr. Howells,
at all events; because his stories do not impress us
by their special dramatic scenes, or supreme moments,
but rather by their completeness. The other
objection, however, has some force here&mdash;the fact
that details may be extended beyond their artistic
proportion, in a manner that does not militate
against the separate instalments, but is seen to mar
the book as a whole. The logging camp incident
in <i>A Modern Instance</i> is prolonged to a fault. Proportion
is sacrificed to realism. From this point
of view, it is well to remember that <i>The Newcomes</i>
appeared in single numbers, whereas <i>Henry Esmond</i>
was published originally as a complete work.</p>

<p>But this slight defect is more than atoned for
by the power shown in the depiction of character.
This is a study of degeneration, not dealing with
remote characters in far-off historical situations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
but brought home to our very doors. One feels
that this dreadful fate might happen to one's neighbours&mdash;might
happen to oneself. It seems to me
a greater book in every way than <i>Romola</i>, though
I am not prepared to say that Mr. Howells is a
greater novelist than George Eliot. There is all
the difference between Tito Melema and Bartley
Hubbard that there is between a fancy picture and
a portrait. Mr. Howells is fond of using Shakespearian
quotations as titles; witness <i>The Counterfeit
Presentment</i>, <i>The Undiscovered Country</i>, <i>The
Quality of Mercy</i>, and <i>A Modern Instance</i>. Now
the word "modern," as every student of Shakespeare
knows, means in the poet's works almost the
opposite of what it signifies to-day. "Full of wise
saws and modern instances" is equivalent to saying
prosaically, "full of sententious proverbs and old,
trite illustrations." In the Shakespearian sense,
Mr. Howells's title might be translated "A Familiar
Example"&mdash;for it is not only a story of modern
American life, it portrays what is unfortunately
an instance all too familiar. Bartley Hubbard is
the typical representative of the "smart" young
American. He is not in the least odious when we
first make his acquaintance. His skill in address
and in adaptation to society assure his instant
popularity; and at heart he is a good fellow, quite
unlike a designing villain. He would rather do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
right than do wrong, provided both are equally
convenient. He simply follows the line of least
resistance. Nor is he by nature a Bohemian; he
loves Marcia, is proud of her fresh beauty, and
enjoys domestic life. Then he has the fascinating
quality of true humour. His conversations with
his wife, when he is free from worry, are exceedingly
attractive to the impersonal listener. He is just
like thousands of clever young American journalists&mdash;quick-witted,
enterprising, energetic, with a
sure nose for news; there is, in fact, only one thing
the matter with Bartley. Although, when life is
flowing evenly, he does not realise his deficiency,
he actually has at heart no moral principle, no
ethical sense, no honour. The career of such a
man will depend entirely upon circumstances;
because his standard of virtue is not where it should
be, within his own mind, but without. Like many
other men, he can resist anything but temptation.
Whether he will become a good citizen or a blackleg,
depends not in the least upon himself, but wholly
upon the events through which he moves. Had he
married exactly the right sort of girl, and had some
rich uncle left the young couple a fortune, it is
probable that neither his friends, nor his wife, nor
even he himself, would have guessed at his capacity
for evil. He would have remained popular in the
community, and died both lamented and respected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
But the difficulty is that he did not marry wisely,
and he subsequently became short of cash. Now,
as some writer has said, it does not matter so much
whether a man marries with wisdom or the reverse,
nor whether he behaves in other emergencies with
prudence or folly; what really matters is how he
behaves himself <i>after</i> the marriage, or after any
other crisis where he may have chosen foolishly.
But Bartley, like many other easy-going youths,
was no man for adverse circumstances. Almost
imperceptibly at first his degeneration begins; his
handsome figure shows a touch of grossness; the
refinement in his face becomes blurred; drinking
ceases to be a pleasure, and becomes a habit. Meanwhile,
as what he calls his bad luck increases, quarrels
with his wife become more frequent; try as he will,
there is always a sheaf of unpaid bills at the end of
the month; his home loses its charm. The mental
and spiritual decline of the man is shown repulsively
by his physical appearance. No one who has read
the book can possibly forget his broad back as he
sits in the courtroom, and the horrible ring of fat
that hangs over his collar. The devil has done his
work with such technique that Bartley as we first
see him, and Bartley as we last see him, seem to
be two utterly different and distinct persons and
personalities; it is with an irrepressible shudder
that we recall the time when this coarse, fat sot was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a slender, graceful young man, who charmed all
acquaintances by his ease of manner and winsome
conversation. And yet, as one looks back over his
life, every stage in the transition is clear, logical,
and wholly natural.</p>

<p>From another point of view this novel is a study
of the passion of jealousy. No other American
novel, so far as I know, has given so accurate a
picture of the gradual and subtle poisoning produced
by this emotion, and only one American play,&mdash;Clyde
Fitch's thoughtful and powerful drama, <i>The
Girl with the Green Eyes</i>. It is curious that jealousy,
so sinister and terrible in its effects on character,
should usually appear on the stage and in fiction
as comic. It is seldom employed as a leading motive
in tragedy, though Shakespeare showed its possibilities;
but one frequently sees it in broad farce.
Of all the passions, there is none which has less
mirth than jealousy. It is fundamentally tragic;
and in <i>A Modern Instance</i>, we see the evil transformation
it works in Marcia, and its force in accelerating
her husband's degeneration. Marcia is an example
of the wish of Keats&mdash;she lives a life of sensations
rather than of thoughts; and jealousy can be conquered
only by mental power, never by emotional.
Marcia has no intellectual resources; her love for
her husband is her whole existence. She has no
more mind than many another American country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
girl who comes home from boarding-school. As
one critic has pointed out, "she has not yet emerged
from the elemental condition of womanhood."
Jealousy is, of course, an "animal quality," and
Marcia, without knowing it, is simply a tamed,
pretty, affectionate young animal. Her jealousy
is entirely without foundation, but it causes her the
most excruciating torment, and constantly widens
the breach between herself and the man she loves.
If she had only married Halleck! She would never
have been jealous with him. But jealousy is like
an ugly weed in a beautiful garden; it exists only
where there is love. And a girl like Marcia could
never have returned the love of a stodgy man like
Halleck. One cannot help asking three vain
questions as one contemplates the ruins of her
happiness and sees the cause. If she had never
met Bartley, and had married Halleck, would she
have been better off? are we to understand that
she is finally saved by Halleck? and if so, what is
the nature of her salvation?</p>

<p>The old sceptical lawyer, Marcia's father, is one
of the most convincing characters that Mr. Howells
has ever drawn. Those who have lived in New
England know this man, for they have seen him
often. He is shrewd, silent, practical, undemonstrative,
yet his unspoken love for his daughter is
almost terrible in its intensity, and finally brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
him to the grave. Although he admires young
Bartley's cleverness, he would have admired him
more had he been less clever. He has a sure instinct
against the young man from the start, and
knows there can be only one outcome of such a
marriage; because he is better acquainted with the
real character of husband and wife than they are
with themselves. Squire Gaylord is a person of
whose creation any novelist in the history of fiction
might be proud.</p>

<p>When <i>A Modern Instance</i> was first published,
a contemporary review called it "a book that all
praise but none like." I imagine that the unpleasant
sensations it awakens in every reader are like those
roused by Mr. Barrie's <i>Sentimental Tommy</i>. The
picture is simply too faithful to be agreeable. Everyone
beholds his own faults and tendencies clearly
portrayed, and the result is quite other than reassuring.
The book finds us all at home. But,
as Gogol, the great Russian, used to say, quoting
an old Slavonic proverb, "We must not blame the
mirror if the face looks ugly."</p>

<p>It is both instructive and entertaining to try the
effect of this novel on a representative group of
American college undergraduates. Those who had
lived in New England villages, and were familiar
with the scenes described, were loud in their praises
of the background, and of the Gaylord family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
One young man remarked&mdash;he was at Yale&mdash;"I
know a young journalist who was last year at Harvard,
who is going to the devil in very much the
same way." Another said, with an experience
hardly consonant with his years, that he had known
women just as jealous as Marcia. Most of them,
however, believed that her jealousy was grossly
exaggerated; it looks so like folly to those yet untouched
by the passion of love. Another truthful
and modest youth said pathetically, "I am too
young to appreciate this book." Still another
remarked with rare lucidity and definiteness of
penetration, "In reading this story somehow something
struck me unfavourably." Minor improbabilities
in the novel produced the greatest shock&mdash;the
hot-scotch episode seemed quite impossible,
and Mr. Howells was thought to be a poor judge
of the effects of whiskey. But the criticism I enjoyed
most came from the undergraduate who said
in all sincerity, "I think this is a very good book
for young ladies to read before getting married."
So indeed it is.</p>

<p>In the year 1902, by the publication of <i>The
Kentons</i>, Mr. Howells gave us a most delightful
surprise. It was like the return of an old friend
from a far journey. In literature it was as though
Björnson should publish a story like <i>A Happy Boy</i>,
or as though Mr. Hardy should give us a tale like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
<i>Under the Greenwood Tree</i>. <i>The Kentons</i> is a
thoroughly charming international novel, containing
the pleasant adventures of an Ohio family on
the ocean liner and in Europe, written in the <i>Aroostook</i>
style, sparkling with humour, and rich in sympathy
and tenderness. Political, social, and ethical
problems are conspicuously absent, and the only
material used by the writer is human nature. This
is one of the best books he has ever written; it has
all the charm of <i>Their Wedding Journey</i>, plus
the wisdom and observation that come only by
years. It is wholesome, healthy, realistic; a
thoroughly representative American novel from a
master's hand. In a French <i>roman</i>, Bittredge
would of course have been a libertine, and one of
the girls ruined by him. In <i>The Kentons</i>, he is
merely <i>fresh</i>, and though he causes some trouble,
everybody in the end is better off for the experience.
Mr. Howells seems especially to dislike <i>Frechheit</i>
in young men, and he has made the vulgarity and
assurance of Bittredge both offensive and absurd.
We have too many Bittredges in the United States;
and some of them do not lose their bittredgidity
with advancing years.</p>

<p>The five members of the Kenton family are
wonderfully well drawn, and are just such people
as we fortunately meet every day. The purity
and sweetness of married and family life are beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
exemplified here; they are exactly what we
see in thousands of American homes, and constitute
the real answer to modern attacks on the
conjugal relation. The judge and his wife are two
companions, growing old together in simplicity
and innocence, happy in the truest sense&mdash;loving
each other far more in age than in youth, which is
perfectly natural in life if not in fiction; because
every day they become more necessary to each other
and have common interests extending over many
years. The scene in their bedroom, as they talk
together before slumber, while the old Judge winds
up his watch, is a veritable triumph of Art.</p>

<p>The younger daughter Lottie is a vivid portrait
of the typical American high-school girl, slangy,
superficial, flirtatious, not quite vulgar, and in every
emergency with young men fully capable of taking
care of herself. After a round of joyous, heart-free,
and innocent familiarities with various youthful
admirers, she finally becomes an admirable wife
and housekeeper. Her sister Ellen is of an opposite
temperament, pale, slight, and non-athletic. She
is entirely different from the Booth Tarkington or
Richard Harding Davis heroine, and in her purity,
delicacy, and refinement, takes us back to old-fashioned
fiction. As a spectator on the steamer
says of her, "that pale girl is adorable." In her
shyness and extraordinary loveliness she reminds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
us of Turgenev's spiritual Lisa. The scene in the
night, where her young brother steals to her bed
and pours into her sympathetic ears all the troubled
passion and sorrow, all the embarrassment and
suffering of his sensitive boy's heart, is exceedingly
beautiful and tender. He knows <i>she</i> will understand.
And at last it is Ellen, and not Lottie, who becomes
the fashionable, aristocratic, New York woman&mdash;preserving
in her wealthy environment all the fruits
of the spirit.</p>

<p>Boyne, the small boy, the "kid brother," is a fine
illustration of the enthusiasm for humanity so characteristic
of Mr. Howells. It is instructive to compare
this little man with the young brother of Daisy
Miller. Both are at the age most trying to their
elders, and both are faithfully portrayed; but
Randolph C. Miller is made particularly obnoxious,
even odious, while one cannot help loving Boyne.
The difference is that one is drawn with the finger
of scorn and the other with the insight of sympathy.
Mr. Howells calls Boyne "a mass of helpless sweetness
though he did not know it." His romantic
love for the young queen of Holland and the burning
mortification he suffers thereby, are sufficiently
easy to understand. The contrast between the high
seriousness with which he takes himself, and the
impression he makes on others, is something that
every man who looks back will remember. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
novelist puts it, "He thought he was an iceberg
when he was merely an ice cream of heroic mould."</p>

<p><i>The Kentons</i>, like some other novels by Mr.
Howells, may seem to many readers superficial,
because it is so largely taken up with the trivial
details of daily existence. It is really a profound
study of life, made by an artist who has not only
the wisdom of the head, but the deeper wisdom of
the heart.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p class="center big">BJÖRNSTJERNE BJÖRNSON</p>


<p>For over half a century this intellectual athlete
has been one of the busiest men in the world. A
partisan fighter born and bred, he has been active
in every political Skandinavian struggle; in religious
questions he has fought first on one side and then
on the other, changing only by honest conviction,
and hitting with all his might every time; to him
the word "education" is as a red rag to a bull, for he
believes that it has been mainly bad, and if people
will only listen, he can make it mainly good; in
a passion of chivalry, he has drawn his pen for the
cause of Woman, whose "sphere" he hopes to
change&mdash;the most modern and the most popular
of all the vain attempts to square the circle; his
powerful voice has been heard on the lecture platform,
not only in his own beloved country, but all
over Europe and in America; he has served for
years as Theatre-Director, in the determination to
convert the playhouse, like everything else he touches,
into a vast moral force. In addition to all the
excitement of a life spent in fighting, his purely
literary activity has been enormous in quantity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
astonishing in range. His numerous dramas treat
of all possible themes, from the old Sagas to modern
divorce laws; and after exhausting all earthly
material, he has boldly advanced into the realm
of the supernatural; his splendid play, <i>Beyond
Human Power</i>, holds the boards in most European
cities, and has exercised a profound influence
on modern drama. His novels are as different
in style and purpose as it is possible for the novels
of one man to be; and some of them are already
classics. A man with such an endowment, with
such tremendous convictions, with buoyant optimism
and terrific energy, has made no small stir in the
world, and it will be a long time before the name of
Björnstjerne Björnson is forgotten.</p>

<p>Had he not possessed, in addition to a fine mind,
a magnificent physical frame, he would long since
have vanished into that spiritual world that has
interested him so deeply. But he has the physique
of a Norse god. Many instances of his bodily
strength and endurance have been cited; it is sufficient
to remember that even after his mane of hair
had become entirely grey he regularly took his bath
by standing naked under a mountain waterfall.
Let that suffice, as one trial of it would for most of
us. He came honestly by his health and vigour,
born as he was on a lonely mountain-side in Norway.
It was in the winter of 1832 that this sturdy baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
gave his first cry for freedom, his father being a
village pastor, whose flock were literally scattered
among steep and desolate rocks, where the salient
feature of the landscape during nine months of the
year was snow. More than once the good shepherd
had to seek and save that which was lost. For
society, the little boy had a few pet animals and the
dreams engendered by supreme loneliness. But
when he was six years old, the father was fortunately
called to a pastorate in a beautiful valley on the west
coast, surrounded by noble and inspiring scenery,
the effect of which is visibly seen in all his early
stories. We cannot help comparing this vale of
beauty, trailing clouds of glory over Björnson's
boyhood, with the flat, wet, dismal gloom of East
Prussia, that oppressed so heavily the child Sudermann,
and made Dame Care look so grey.</p>

<p>At the grammar school, at the high school, and at
the university he showed little interest in the curriculum,
and no particular aptitude for study;
but before leaving college he had already begun
original composition, and at the age of twenty-four
he published a masterpiece. This was the pastoral
romance, <i>Synnövé Solbakken</i>, which for sheer beauty
of style and atmosphere he has never surpassed.
For some years preceding the date of its appearance
there had been a lull in literary activity in Norway.
Out of this premonitory hush of stillness came a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
beautiful voice, which by the newness and freshness
of its tones aroused immediate interest. Everybody
listened, enchanted by the strange harmony. Men
saw that a new prophet had arisen in Israel. The
absolute simplicity of the style, the naïveté of the
story, the naturalness of the characters, the short,
passionate sentences like those of the Sagas, the
lyrically poetic atmosphere, appealed at once to the
Norwegian heart. Why is it that we are surprised
in books and in plays by simple language and natural
characters? It must be that we are so accustomed
to literary conventions remote from actual life, that
when we behold real people and hear natural talk
in works of art our first emotion is glad astonishment.
For the same reason we praise certain persons for
displaying what we call common sense. Be this
as it may, no one believed that a pastoral romance
could be so vigorous, so fresh, and so true. Of all
forms of literature, pastoral tales, whether in verse
or in prose, have been commonly the most artificial
and the most insipid; but here was the breath of
life. I can recommend nothing better for the soul
weary of the closeness of modern naturalism than a
course of reading in the early work of Björnson.</p>

<p>He followed this initial success with three other
beautiful prose lyrics&mdash;<i>Arne</i>, <i>A Happy Boy</i>, and
<i>The Fisher Maiden</i>. These stories exhibit the same
qualities so strikingly displayed in <i>Synnövé Solbakken</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
In all this artistic production Björnson is an impressionist,
reproducing with absolute fidelity what he
saw, both in the world of matter and of spirit. We
may rely faithfully on the correctness of these pictures,
whether they portray natural scenery, country customs,
or peasant character. We inhale Norway. We
can smell the pines. The nipping and eager air, the
dark green resinous forests&mdash;we feel these as
plainly as if we were physically present in the Land
of the Midnight Sun. The kindly simplicity of the
peasants, the village ceremonies at weddings and
funerals, the cheerful loneliness with sheep on
mountain pasture, and the subdued but universal
note of deep rural piety, make one feel as though
the whole community were bound by gold chains
about the feet of God. Björnson says, "The church
is in the foreground of Norwegian peasant life."
And indeed everything seems to centre around
God's acre, and the spire of the meeting-house
points in the same direction as the stories themselves.
Many beautiful passages affect us like noble music;
our eyes are filled with happy tears.</p>

<p>In view of the strong and ardent personality of
the author, it is curious that these early romances
should be so truly objective. One feels his personality
in a general way, as one feels that of Turgenev;
but the young writer separates himself entirely from
the course of the story; he nowhere interferes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
The characters apparently develop without his
assistance, as the events take place without any
manipulation. As a work of objective art, <i>Synnövé
Solbakken</i> approaches flawless perfection. It has
one plot, which travels in one direction&mdash;forward.
The persons are intensely Norwegian, but there
their similarity ends. Each is individualised. The
simplicity of the story is so remarkable that to some
superficial and unobservant readers it has seemed
childish. The very acme of Art is so close to nature
that it sometimes is mistaken for no art at all, like
the acting of Garrick or the style of Jane Austen.
Adverse criticisms are the highest compliments.
Language is well managed when it expresses profound
thoughts in words clear to a child.</p>

<p>The love scenes in this narrative are idyllic; in
fact, the whole book is an idyl. It seems radiant
with sunshine. It is as pure as a mountain lake,
and as refreshing. And besides the artistic unity
of the work, that satisfies one's standards so fully,
there is an exquisite something hard to define; a
play of fancy, a veil of poetic beauty lingering over
the story, that makes us feel when we have closed
the book as if we were gazing at a clear winter
sunset.</p>

<p>Björnson has the creative imagination of the true
poet. In the wonderful prologue to <i>Arne</i> he gives
the trees separate personalities, in a manner to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
arouse almost the envy of Thomas Hardy. Indeed,
the author of <i>The Woodlanders</i> has never felt the
trees more intensely than the Norwegian novelist.
The prose style unconsciously breaks into verse
form at times, with the natural grace and ease of
a singing bird. Not the least charming incidents
in Björnson's romances are the frequent lyrics,
that spring up like cowslips in a pasture.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Punctual as Springtide forth peep they."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The novels in Björnson's second period are so
totally unlike those we have just been considering
that if all his work had been published anonymously,
no one would have ventured to say that the same
man had written <i>A Happy Boy</i> and <i>In God's Way</i>.
There came a pause in his creative activity. He
wrote little imaginative literature, and many thought
the well of his inspiration had gone dry. Really
he was passing through a belated <i>Sturm und Drang</i>;
a tremendous intellectual struggle and fermentation
had set in, from which he emerged mentally a changed
man, with a new outfit of opinions and ideas. At
nearly the same time his great contemporary Tolstoi
was also in the Slough of Despond, but he
climbed out on the other side and set his face towards
the Celestial City. Björnson's floundering ultimately
carried him in precisely the opposite direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
While Tolstoi was studying the New Testament,
Björnson applied himself to Darwin, Mill, and
Spencer, and became completely converted from
the Christianity of his youth. Many minds would
have been temporarily paralysed by such a result,
and would finally have become either pessimistic
or coldly critical. But Björnson simply could not
endure to be a gloomy, cynical spectator of life,
like his countryman, Ibsen, any more than he could
leave his native land and calmly view its nakedness
from the comfortable environment of Munich or
Rome. Björnson has the sort of intellect that cannot
remain in equilibrium. He was ever a fighter,
and cannot live without something to fight for.
The natural optimism of his temperament, so opposed
in every way to the blank despair of Ibsen, made
him see in his new views the way of salvation. He
is just as sure he is right now as he was when he
held opinions exactly the contrary. With joyful
ardour he became the champion and propagandist
of democracy in politics and of free thought in religion;
apparently adopting Spencer's saying, "To
the true reformer no institution is sacred, no belief
above criticism." For the word "reformer" precisely
describes Björnson; like the chief characters in
his later novels, he is an apostle of reform, zealous,
tireless, and tiresome.</p>

<p>Lowell, in his fine essay on Gray, said that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
reason why the eighteenth century was so comfortable
was that "responsibility for the universe
had not yet been invented." Now Björnson
feels this responsibility with all the strength of his
nature, and however admirable it may be as a moral
quality, it has vitiated his artistic career. As he
renounced Christianity for agnosticism, so he renounced
romance for realism. The novels written
since 1875 are not only unlike his early pastoral
romances in literary style; they are totally different
productions in tone, in spirit, and in intention.
And, from the point of view of art, they are, in my
opinion, as inferior to the work of his youth as Hawthorne's
campaign <i>Life of Pierce</i> is inferior to <i>The
Scarlet Letter</i>. In every way Björnson is farther
off from heaven than when he was a boy.</p>

<p>In addition to many short sketches, his later
period includes three realistic novels. These are:
<i>Flags Are Flying in Town and Harbour</i>, translated
into English with the title, <i>The Heritage of the
Kurts</i>, for it is a study in heredity; <i>In God's
Way</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> loudly proclaimed as his masterpiece, and
<i>Mary</i>. The first two originally attracted more
attention abroad than at home. The <i>Flags</i> hung
idly in Norway, and the orthodox were not anxious
to get in God's way. But the second book
produced considerable excitement in England, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
finally reacted in Christiania and Copenhagen; it
is still hotly discussed. In these three novels the
author has stepped out of the rôle of artist and
become a kind of professor of pedagogy, his speciality
being the education of women. In <i>Flags</i> the
principal part of the story is taken up with a girls'
school, which gives the novelist an opportunity to
include a confused study of heredity, and to air all
sorts of educational theory. The chief one appears
to be that in the curriculum for young girls the
"major" should be physiology. Hygiene, which
so many bewildered persons are accepting just now
in lieu of the Gospel, plays a heavy part in Björnson's
later work. The gymnasium in <i>Flags</i> takes the
place of the church in <i>Synnövé</i>; and acrobatic feats
of the body are deemed more healthful than the
religious aspirations of the soul. Kallem, a prominent
character of the story <i>In God's Way</i>, usually
appears walking on his hands, which is not the
only fashion in which he is upside down. The book
<i>Flags</i> is, frankly speaking, an intolerable bore.
The hero, Rendalen, who also appears in the subsequent
novel, is the mouthpiece of the new opinions
of the author; a convenient if clumsy device, for
whenever Björnson wishes to expound his views
on education, hygiene, or religion, he simply makes
Rendalen deliver a lecture. Didactic novels are
in general a poor substitute either for learning or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
for fiction, but they are doubly bad when the author
is confused in his ideas of science and in his notions
of art. One general "lesson" emerges from the
jargon of this book&mdash;that men should suffer for
immorality as severely as women, a doctrine neither
new nor practicable. The difficulty is that with
Björnson, as with some others who shout this edict,
the equalising of the punishment takes the form of
leaving the men as they are, and issuing a general
pardon to the women. Rendalen, the head-master
of the school, is constantly bringing up this topic,
and he makes it the chief subject for discussion in
the girls' debating society! These females are
going to be emancipated. A pseudo-scientific twist
is also given to this novel by the introduction of
mesmerism and hypnotic influence, matters in which
the author is deeply interested. We are given to
understand that a large number of women are
annually ruined, not by their lack of moral conviction
and will power, but simply by the hypnotic
influence of men. One may perhaps reasonably
doubt the ultimate value of a wide dissemination
of this great idea, especially in a young ladies'
seminary. To the unsympathetic reader, the one
question that will keep him afloat in all this welter,
is not concerned with pedagogy; it is the honest
attempt to discover why the book bears its strange
title. Unfortunately he will not find out until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
last leaf. Then</p>

<blockquote><p>"the connexion of which with the plot one sees."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is pleasant to take up the volume <i>In God's
Way</i>, for, however disappointing it may be to those
who know the young Björnson, it is vastly superior
to <i>Flags</i>. It is what is called to-day a "strong"
novel, and has naturally evoked the widest variation
of comment. By many it has been greeted with
enthusiastic admiration and by many with outspoken
disgust. Psychologically, it is indeed powerful.
The characters are interesting, and they develop
in a way that may or may not be God's, but
resemble His in being mysterious. One cannot
foresee in the early chapters what is going to happen
to the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, nor what is to be our final
attitude toward any of them. Think of the impression
made on us by our first acquaintance with
Josephine, or Kallem, or Ragni, or Ole; and then
compare it with the state of our feelings as we draw
near the end. Not one of these characters remains
the same; each one develops, and develops as
he might in actual life. Björnson does not approach
his men and women from an easy chair,
in the descriptive manner; once created, we feel
that they would grow without his aid.</p>

<p>For all this particular triumph of art, <i>In God's
Way</i> is plainly a didactic novel, with the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
preaching from beginning to end. The "fighting"
quality in the novelist gets the better of his literary
genius. We have a story in the extreme realistic
style, marked by occasional scenes of great beauty
and force; but the exposition of doctrine is somewhat
vague and confused, and the construction of
the whole work decidedly inartistic. Two general
points, however, are made clear: First, that one may
walk in God's way without believing in God. Religion
is of no importance in comparison with conduct,
nor have the two things any vital or necessary
connexion. This is a modern view, and perhaps
a natural reaction from the strictness of Björnson's
childhood training. Second, that virtue is a matter
entirely of the heart, bearing no relation whatever
to the statute-book. A woman may be legally an
adulteress and yet absolutely pure. This also is
quite familiar to us in the pages of modern dramatists
and novelists. Björnson has taken an extraordinary
instance to prove his thesis, a thesis
that perhaps needs no emphasis, for human nature
is only too well disposed to make its moral creed
coincide with its bodily instincts.</p>

<p>The same theme&mdash;mental as opposed to physical
female chastity&mdash;is the leading idea of <i>Mary</i>, a
novel that has had considerable success in Norway
and in Germany, but has only this year been translated
into English. This work of his old age shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
not the slightest trace of decay. It is an interesting
and powerful analysis of a girl's heart, written in
short, vigorous sentences. Mary, after taking plenty
of time for reflexion, and without any solicitation,
deliberately gives herself to her lover, in a manner
exactly similar to a scene in Maupassant's novel,
<i>Notre C&oelig;ur</i>. Her fiancé is naturally amazed, as
there has been nothing leading up to this; she
comes to him of her own free will. Her theory of
conduct (which exemplifies that of Björnson) is
that a woman is the sovereign mistress of her own
body, and can do what she pleases. There is nothing
immoral in a woman's free gift of herself to her
lover, provided she does it out of her royal bounty,
and not as a weak yielding to masculine pursuit.
The next day Mary is grievously disappointed to
discover that, instead of the homage and worship
she expected, the erstwhile timid lover glories in
the sense of possession. She fears that she cannot
live an absolutely independent life with such a
husband&mdash;and Björnson's gospel is, of course, the
untrammelled freedom of woman. So, although
she is about to become a mother, she deliberately
cancels the engagement to the putative child's
father; this puzzles him even more than her previous
conduct, though he is forced to acquiesce. Then,
in a final access of despair, as she is about to commit
suicide, she is rescued by a man whose love is like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the moth's for the star&mdash;who tells her that no matter
what she has done, she is the noblest, purest woman
on earth, and the chaste queen of his heart. Thus,
by a stroke of good fortune, rather than by anything
inevitable in the story, the book ends happily,
with Mary and her second adoring lover in the very
delirium of joy. It is evident that the novel is
nothing but a <i>Tendenz-Roman</i>; Björnson wishes
us to approve of his heroine's conduct throughout&mdash;of
the entirely unnecessary sacrifice of her virtue,
of the subsequent sacrifice of her reputation, and
of her remorseless joy in the arms of another man.
Such is to be the doctrine of sex equality; men are
not to be made more virtuous, but the freedom
of women is not only to be pardoned, but approved.</p>

<p>In comparing the three late with the four early
novels, the most striking change is instantly apparent
to anyone who reads <i>Synnövé Solbakken</i> and then
opens <i>In God's Way</i>. It is the sudden and depressing
change of air, from the mountains to the sick-room.
The abundance of medical detail in the
later novel is almost nauseating, and would be
wholly so were it not absurd. One has only to
compare the invigorating scenery and the simple
love scenes in <i>Synnövé</i> with the minute examination
of Ragni's spittle (for tuberculosis) in the other
book&mdash;but enough is said. Despite all that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
been written in praise of Björnson's "courage"
in dealing with problems of sex and disease, I sympathise
with the cry of his friend in 1879:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Come back again, dear Björnson, come back!"</p></blockquote>

<p>It is easy to see that the influence of modern
English scepticism cannot account entirely for the
revolution in the Norwegian's mind and art. We
can clearly observe an attraction much nearer,
that has drawn this luminous star so far out of its
course. It is none other than the mighty Ibsen.
Ibsen's analysis of disease, his examination of
marriage problems, his Ishmaelite attacks on the
present structure of civilised society&mdash;all this
has had its effect on his contemporary and countryman.
As a destructive force Ibsen was stronger
than Björnson, because he was ruthless. But one
had the courage of despair, while the other has the
courage of hope. Björnson does not believe in
Fate and is not afraid of it. He loves and believes
in humanity. His gloomiest books end with a
vision. There is always a rift in the clouds.
Throughout all his career he has set his face steadfastly
toward what he has taken to be the true light.
Such men compel admiration, no matter whose
colours they bear. And however much we may
deplore his present course, we cannot now echo the
cry of his friend and say, "Come back!" The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
language of the poet better expresses our attitude:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p class="center big">MARK TWAIN</p>


<p>During the last twenty years, a profound change
has taken place in the attitude of the reading public
toward Mark Twain. I can remember very well
when he was regarded merely as a humorist, and
one opened his books with an anticipatory grin.
Very few supposed that he belonged to literature;
and a complete, uniform edition of his <i>Works</i>
would perhaps have been received with something
of the mockery that greeted Ben Jonson's folio in
1616. Professor Richardson's <i>American Literature</i>,
which is still a standard work, appeared originally
in 1886. My copy, which bears the date 1892,
contains only two references in the index to Mark
Twain, while Mr. Cable, for example, receives ten;
and the whole volume fills exactly nine hundred and
ninety pages. Looking up one of the two references,
we find the following opinion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"But there is a class of writers, authors ranking below
Irving or Lowell, and lacking the higher artistic or moral
purpose of the greater humorists, who amuse a generation
and then pass from sight. Every period demands a new
manner of jest, after the current fashion.... The reigning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
favourites of the day are Frank R. Stockton, Joel Chandler
Harris, the various newspaper jokers, and 'Mark Twain.'
But the creators of 'Pomona' and 'Rudder Grange,' of 'Uncle
Remus and his Folk-lore Stories,' and 'Innocents Abroad,'
clever as they are, must make hay while the sun shines.
Twenty years hence, unless they chance to enshrine their
wit in some higher literary achievement, their unknown successors
will be the privileged comedians of the republic.
Humour alone never gives its masters a place in literature;
it must coexist with literary qualities, and must usually
be joined with such pathos as one finds in Lamb, Hood,
Irving, or Holmes."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to remember that before this
pronouncement was published, <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i> had been read by thousands.
Professor Richardson continued: "Two or three
divisions of American humour deserve somewhat
more respectful treatment," and he proceeds to give
a full page to Petroleum V. Nasby, another page to
Artemus Ward, and two and one-half pages to Josh
Billings, while Mark Twain had received less than
four lines. After stating that, in the case of authors
like Mark Twain, "temporary amusement, not
literary product, is the thing sought and given,"
Professor Richardson announces that the department
of fiction will be considered later. In this
"department," Mark Twain is not mentioned at all,
although Julian Hawthorne receives over three pages!</p>

<p>I have quoted Professor Richardson at length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
because he is a deservedly high authority, and well
represents an attitude toward Mark Twain that was
common all during the eighties. Another college professor,
who is to-day one of the best living American
critics, says, in his <i>Initial Studies in American Letters</i>
(1895), "Though it would be ridiculous to maintain
that either of these writers [Artemus Ward and Mark
Twain] takes rank with Lowell and Holmes, ...
still it will not do to ignore them as mere buffoons,
or even to predict that their humours will soon be
forgotten." There is no allusion in his book to
<i>Tom Sawyer</i> or <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, nor does the
critic seem to regard their creator as in any sense
a novelist. Still another writer, in a passing allusion
to Mark Twain, says, "Only a very small portion
of his writing has any place as literature."</p>

<p>Literary opinions change as time progresses; and
no one could have observed the remarkable demonstration
at the seventieth birthday of our great
national humorist without feeling that most of
his contemporaries regarded him, not as their peer,
but as their Chief. Without wishing to make any
invidious comparisons, I cannot refrain from commenting
on the statement that it would be "ridiculous"
to maintain that Mark Twain takes rank
with Oliver Wendell Holmes. It is, of course,
absolutely impossible to predict the future; the only
real test of the value of a book is Time. Who now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
reads Cowley? Time has laughed at so many
contemporary judgements that it would be foolhardy
to make positive assertions about literary
stock quotations one hundred years from now.
Still, guesses are not prohibited; and I think it
not unlikely that the name of Mark Twain will outlast
the name of Holmes. American Literature
would surely be the poorer if the great Boston
Brahmin had not enlivened it with his rich humour,
his lambent wit, and his sincere pathos; but the
whole content of his work seems slighter than the
big American prose epics of the man of our day.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems to me that Mark Twain is our
foremost living American writer. He has not the
subtlety of Henry James or the wonderful charm
of Mr. Howells; he could not have written <i>Daisy
Miller</i>, or <i>A Modern Instance</i>, or <i>Indian Summer</i>,
or <i>The Kentons</i>&mdash;books which exhibit literary
quality of an exceedingly high order. I have read
them over and over again, with constantly increasing
profit and delight. I wish that Mr. Howells
might live for ever, and give to every generation
the pure intellectual joy that he has given to ours.
But the natural endowment of Mark Twain is still
greater. Mr. Howells has made the most of himself;
God has done it all for Mark Twain. If
there be a living American writer touched with true
genius, whose books glow with the divine fire, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
is he. He has always been a conscientious artist;
but no amount of industry could ever have produced
a <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>.</p>

<p>When I was a child at the West Middle Grammar
School of Hartford, on one memorable April day,
Mark Twain addressed the graduating-class. I
was thirteen years old, but I have found it impossible
to forget what he said. The subject of his "remarks"
was Methuselah. He informed us that
Methuselah lived to the ripe old age of nine hundred
and sixty-nine. But he might as well have lived
to be several thousand&mdash;nothing happened. The
speaker told us that we should all live longer than
Methuselah. Fifty years of Europe are better than
a cycle of Cathay, and twenty years of modern
American life are longer and richer in content than the
old patriarch's thousand. Ours will be the true age
in which to live, when more will happen in a day
than in a year of the flat existence of our ancestors.
I cannot remember his words; but what a fine thing
it is to hear a speech, and carry away an idea!</p>

<p>I have since observed that this idea runs through
much of his literary work. His philosophy of life
underlies his broadest burlesque&mdash;for <i>A Connecticut
Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> is simply an exposure
of the "good old times." Mark Twain
believes in the Present, in human progress. Too
often do we apprehend the Middle Ages through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the glowing pages of Spenser and Walter Scott;
we see only glittering processions of ladies dead
and lovely knights. Mark Twain shows us the
wretched condition of the common people, their
utter ignorance and degradation, the coarseness
and immorality of technical chivalry, the cruel
and unscrupulous ecclesiastical tyranny, and the
capricious insolence of the barons. One may
regret that he has reversed the dynamics in so
glorious a book as Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, but,
through all the buffoonery and roaring mirth with
which the knights in armour are buried, the artistic
and moral purpose of the satirist is clear. If I
understand him rightly, he would have us believe
that <i>our</i> age, not theirs, is the "good time"; nay,
ours is the age of magic and wonder. We need
not regret in melancholy sentimentality the picturesqueness
of bygone days, for we ourselves live, not
in a material and commonplace generation, but
in the very midst of miracles and romance. Merlin
and the Fay Morgana would have given all their
petty skill to have been able to use a telephone or
a phonograph, or to see a moving picture. The
sleeping princess and her castle were awakened
by a kiss; but in the twentieth century a man in
Washington touches a button, and hundreds of
miles away tons of machinery begin to move, fountains
begin to play, and the air resounds with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
whir of wheels. In comparison with to-day, the
age of chivalry seems dull and poor. Even in
chivalry itself our author is more knightly than
Lancelot; for was there ever a more truly chivalrous
performance than Mark Twain's essay on Harriet
Shelley, or his literary monument to Joan of Arc?
In these earnest pages, our national humorist
appears as the true knight.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's humour is purely American. It
is not the humour of Washington Irving, which
resembles that of Addison and Thackeray; it is
not delicate and indirect. It is genial, sometimes
outrageous, mirth&mdash;laughter holding both his
sides. I have found it difficult to read him in a
library or on a street-car, for explosions of pent-up
mirth or a distorted face are apt to attract unpleasant
attention in such public places. Mark Twain's
humour is boisterous, uproarious, colossal, overwhelming.
As has often been remarked, the Americans
are not naturally a gay people, like the French;
nor are we light-hearted and careless, like the Irish
and the Negro. At heart, we are intensely serious,
nervous, melancholy. For humour, therefore, we
naturally turn to buffoonery and burlesque, as a
reaction against the strain and tension of life. Our
attitude is something like that of the lonely author
of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, who used to lean
over the parapet of Magdalen Bridge, and shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
with mirth at the obscene jokes of the bargemen.
We like Mark Twain's humour, not because we are
frivolous, but because we are just the reverse. I
have never known a frivolous person who really
enjoyed or appreciated Mark Twain.</p>

<p>The essence of Mark Twain's humour is Incongruity.
The jumping frog is named Daniel Webster;
and, indeed, the intense gravity of a frog's face,
with the droop at the corners of the mouth, might
well be envied by many an American Senator.
When the shotted frog vainly attempted to leave
the earth, he shrugged his shoulders "like a Frenchman."
Bilgewater and the Dolphin on the raft
are grotesquely incongruous figures. The rescuing
of Jim from his prison cell is full of the most incongruous
ideas, his common-sense attitude toward the
whole transaction contrasting strangely with that
of the romantic Tom. Along with the constant
incongruity goes the element of surprise&mdash;which
Professor Beers has well pointed out. When one
begins a sentence, in an apparently serious discussion,
one never knows how it will end. In discussing
the peace that accompanies religious faith,
Mark Twain says that he has often been impressed
with the calm confidence of a Christian with four
aces. Exaggeration&mdash;deliberate, enormous hyperbole&mdash;is
another feature. Rudyard Kipling, who
has been profoundly influenced by Mark Twain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and has learned much from him, often employs
the same device, as in <i>Brugglesmith</i>. Irreverence
is also a noteworthy quality. In his travel-books,
we are given the attitude of the typical American
Philistine toward the wonders and sacred relics of
the Old World, the whole thing being a gigantic
burlesque on the sentimental guide-books which
were so much in vogue before the era of Baedeker.
With such continuous fun and mirth, satire and
burlesque, it is no wonder that Mark Twain should
not always be at his best. He is doubtless sometimes
flat, sometimes coarse, as all humorists since
Rabelais have been. The wonder is that his level
has been so high. I remember, just before the
appearance of <i>Following the Equator</i>, I had been
told that Mark Twain's inspiration was finally
gone, and that he could not be funny if he tried.
To test this, I opened the new book, and this is
what I found on the first page:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"We sailed for America, and there made certain preparations.
This took but little time. Two members of my
family elected to go with me. Also a carbuncle. The dictionary
says a carbuncle is a kind of jewel. Humour is out
of place in a dictionary."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although Mark Twain has the great qualities of
the true humorist&mdash;common sense, human sympathy,
and an accurate eye for proportion&mdash;he is
much more than a humorist. His work shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
high literary quality, the quality that appears in
first-rate novels. He has shown himself to be a
genuine artist. He has done something which
many popular novelists have signally failed to accomplish&mdash;he
has created real characters. His
two wonderful boys, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry
Finn, are wonderful in quite different ways. The
creator of Tom exhibited remarkable observation;
the creator of Huck showed the divine touch of
imagination. Tom is the American boy&mdash;he is
"smart." In having his fence whitewashed, in
controlling a pool of Sabbath-school tickets at the
precise psychological moment, he displays abundant
promise of future success in business. Huck, on
the other hand, is the child of nature, harmless, sincere,
and crudely imaginative. His reasonings with
Jim about nature and God belong to the same
department of natural theology as that illustrated
in Browning's <i>Caliban</i>. The night on the raft with
Jim, when these two creatures look aloft at the stars,
and Jim reckons the moon <i>laid</i> them, is a case in
point.</p>

<blockquote><p>"We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we
used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss
about whether they was made or just happened. Jim he
allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I
judged it would have took too long to <i>make</i> so many. Jim
said the moon could a <i>laid</i> them; well, that looked kind
of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done.
We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak
down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of
the nest."</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Mark Twain has so much dramatic power
that, were his literary career beginning instead of
closing, he might write for us the great American
play that we are still awaiting. The story of the
feud between the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons
is thrillingly dramatic, and the tragic climax
seizes the heart. The shooting of the drunken
Boggs, the gathering of the mob, and its control
by one masterful personality, belong essentially to
true drama, and are written with power and insight.
The pathos of these scenes is never false, never
mawkish or overdone; it is the pathos of life itself.
Mark Twain's extraordinary skill in descriptive
passages shows, not merely keen observation, but
the instinct for the specific word&mdash;the one word
that is always better than any of its synonyms, for
it makes the picture real&mdash;it creates the illusion,
which is the essence of all literary art. The storm,
for example:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned
in anyway if I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a
storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My
souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second
or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a
half a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind;
then comes a <i>h-wach</i>!&mdash;bum! bum! bumble-umble-umbum-bum-bum-bum&mdash;and
the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away, and quit&mdash;and then <i>rip</i> comes another
flash and another sockdolager. The waves 'most washed
me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and
didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble about snags; the
lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that
we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this
way or that and miss them."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> are prose
epics of American life. The former is one of those
books&mdash;of which <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, <i>Gulliver's
Travels</i>, and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> are supreme examples&mdash;that
are read at different periods of one's life
from very different points of view; so that it is not
easy to say when one enjoys them the most&mdash;before
one understands their real significance or after.
Nearly all healthy boys enjoy reading <i>Tom Sawyer</i>,
because the intrinsic interest of the story is so great,
and the various adventures of the hero are portrayed
with such gusto. Yet it is impossible to outgrow
the book. The eternal Boy is there, and one cannot
appreciate the nature of boyhood properly until
one has ceased to be a boy. The other masterpiece,
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, is really not a child's book at all.
Children devour it, but they do not digest it. It
is a permanent picture of a certain period of American
history, and this picture is made complete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
not so much by the striking portraits of individuals
placed on the huge canvas, as by the vital unity of
the whole composition. If one wishes to know
what life on the Mississippi really was, to know
and understand the peculiar social conditions of
that highly exciting time, one has merely to read
through this powerful narrative, and a definite,
coherent, vivid impression remains.</p>

<p>By those who have lived there, and whose minds
are comparatively free from prejudice, Mark Twain's
pictures of life in the South before the war are regarded
as, on the whole, nearer the truth than those
supplied by any other artist. One reason for this
is the aim of the author; he was not trying to support
or to defend any particular theory&mdash;no, his aim
was purely and wholly artistic. In <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i>, a book by no means devoid of literary art,
the red-hot indignation of the author largely nullified
her evident desire to tell the truth. If one succeeds
in telling the truth about anything whatever, one
must have something more than the <i>desire</i> to tell
the truth; one must know how to do it. False
impressions do not always, probably do not commonly,
come from deliberate liars. Mrs. Stowe's
astonishing work is not really the history of slavery;
it is the history of abolition sentiment. On the
other hand, writers so graceful, talented, and clever
as Mr. Page and Mr. Hopkinson Smith do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
always give us pictures that correctly represent,
except locally, the actual situation before the war;
for these gentlemen seem to have <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i> in mind. Mark Twain gives us both points
of view; he shows us the beautiful side of slavery,&mdash;for
it had a wonderfully beautiful, patriarchal side,&mdash;and
he also shows us the horror of it. The living
dread of the Negro that he would be sold down the
river, has never been more vividly represented than
when the poor woman in <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> sees
the water swirling against the snag, and realises
that she is bound the wrong way. That one scene
makes an indelible impression on the reader's mind,
and counteracts tons of polemics. The peculiar
harmlessness of Jim is beautiful to contemplate.
Although he and Huck really own the raft, and have
taken all the risk, they obey implicitly the orders of
the two tramps who call themselves Duke and King.
Had that been a raft on the Connecticut River,
and had Huck and Jim been Yankees, they would
have said to the intruders, "Whose raft is this,
anyway?"</p>

<p>Mark Twain may be trusted to tell the truth;
for the eye of the born caricature artist always sees
the salient point. Caricatures often give us a better
idea of their object than a photograph; for the
things that are exaggerated, be it a large nose, or
a long neck, are, after all, the things that differentiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
this particular individual from the mass. Everybody
remembers how Tweed was caught by one of
Nast's cartoons.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is through and through American.
If foreigners really wish to know the American
spirit, let them read Mark Twain. He is far more
American than their favourite specimen, Walt
Whitman. The essentially American qualities of
common sense, energy, enterprise, good-humour,
and Philistinism fairly shriek from his pages. He
reveals us in our limitations, in our lack of appreciation
of certain beautiful things, fully as well as
he pictures us in coarser but more triumphant aspects.
It is, of course, preposterous to say that Americans
are totally different from other humans; we have
no monopoly of common sense and good-humour,
nor are we all hide-bound Philistines. But there is
something pronounced in the American character,
and the books of Mark Twain reveal it. He has
also more than once been a valuable and efficient
champion. Without being an offensive and blatant
Jingo, I think he is content to be an American.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is our great Democrat. Democracy
is his political, social, and moral creed. His hatred
of snobbery, affectation, and assumed superiority
is total. His democracy has no limits; it is bottom-less
and far-reaching. Nothing seems really sacred
to him except the sacred right of every individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to do exactly as he pleases; which means, of course,
that no one can interfere with another's right, for
then democracy would be the privilege of a few,
and would stultify itself. Not only does the spirit
of democracy breathe out from all his greater books,
but it is shown in specific instances, such as <i>Travelling
with a Reformer</i>; and Mark Twain has more
than once given testimony for his creed, without
recourse to the pen.</p>

<p>At the head of all American novelists, living and
dead, stands Nathaniel Hawthorne, unapproached,
possibly unapproachable. His fine and subtle
art is an altogether different thing from the art of
our mighty, democratic, national humorist. But
Literature is wonderfully diverse in its content;
and the historian of American Letters, in the far
future, will probably find it impossible to omit the
name of Mark Twain.</p>

<p class="center big">HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ</p>


<p>In a private letter to a friend, written in 1896,
the late Mr. Charles Dudley Warner remarked:
"I am just reading <i>Children of the Soil</i>, which I got
in London before I sailed. It confirms me in my
very high opinion of him. I said the other day
that I think him at the head of living novelists,
both in range, grasp of a historical situation, intuition
and knowledge of human nature. Comparisons
are always dangerous, but I know no
historical novelist who is his superior, or who is
more successful in creating characters. His canvas
is very large, and in the beginning of his historical
romances the reader needs patience, but the picture
finally comes out vividly, and the episodes in the
grand story are perfectly enthralling. Of his novels
of modern life I cannot speak too highly. The
subtlety of his analysis is wonderful, and the shades
of character are delineated by slight but always
telling strokes. There is the same reality in them
that is in his romances. As to the secret of his
power, who can say? It is genius (I still believe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
that word) but re-enforced by very hard labour and
study, by much reading, and by acute observation."</p>

<p>This letter may serve as an excellent summary
of the opinions of many intelligent American critics
concerning a writer whose name was unknown to
us in 1890, and of whom the whole world was talking
in 1895.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> One reason&mdash;apart from their intrinsic
excellence&mdash;for the Byronic suddenness of the fame
of the Polish Trilogy, was the psychological opportuneness
of its appearance. In England and in America
the recent Romantic Revival was at its flood;
we were all reading historical romances, and were
hungry for more. Sienkiewicz satisfied us by providing
exactly what we were looking for. In his own
country he was idolised, for his single pen had
done more than many years of tumultuous discussion,
to put Poland back on the map of Europe. At the
exercises commemorating the five hundredth anniversary
of the University of Cracow, the late President
Gilman, who had the well-deserved honour
of speaking for the universities of America, said:
"America thanks Poland for three great names:
Copernicus, to whom all the world is indebted;
Kosciuszko, who spilled his blood for American
independence; and Sienkiewicz, whose name is
a household word in thousands of American homes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and who has introduced Poland to the American
people."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Sienkiewicz was born in 1845. After student
days at Warsaw, he came over in 1876-1877 to California,
in a party that included Madame Modjeska.
They attempted to establish a kind of socialistic
community, which bears in the retrospect a certain
resemblance to Brook Farm. Fortunately for the
cause of art, which the world needs more than it
does socialism, the enterprise was a failure. Sienkiewicz
returned to Poland, and began his literary
career; Madame Modjeska became one of the
chief ornaments of the English stage for a quarter
of a century. Her ashes now rest in the ancient
Polish city where President Gilman uttered his fine
tribute to the friend of her youth.</p>

<p>The three great Polish romances were all written
in the eighties; and at about the same time the
author was also engaged in the composition of purely
realistic work, which displays his powers in a quite
different form of art, and constitutes the most original&mdash;though
not the most popular&mdash;part of his literary
production. The <i>Children of the Soil</i>, which some
of the elect in Poland consider his masterpiece,
is a novel, constructed and executed in the strictest
style of realism; <i>Without Dogma</i> is still farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
removed from the Romantic manner, for it is
a story of psychological analytical introspection.
Sienkiewicz himself regards <i>Children of the Soil</i>
as his favourite, although he is "not prepared to say
just why." And <i>Without Dogma</i> he thinks to be
"in many respects my strongest work." It is
evident that he does not consider himself primarily
a maker of stirring historical romance. But in
the nineties he returned to this form of fiction,
producing his Roman panorama called <i>Quo Vadis</i>,
which, although it has made the biggest noise of
all his books, is perhaps the least valuable. Like
<i>Ben Hur</i>, it was warmed over into a tremendously
successful melodrama, and received the final compliment
of parody.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Toward the close of the century,
Sienkiewicz completed another massive historical
romance, <i>The Knights of the Cross</i>, which,
in its abundant action, striking characterisation,
and charming humour, recalled the Trilogy; this
was followed by <i>On the Field of Glory</i>, and we may
confidently expect more, though never too much;
he simply could not be dull if he tried.</p>

<p>In a time like ours, when literary tabloids take
the place of wholesome mental food, when many
successful novels can be read at a sitting or a lying&mdash;requiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
no exertion either of soul or body&mdash;the
portentous size of these Polish stories is a magnificent
challenge. If some books are to be tasted,
others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed
and digested, what shall we do with Sienkiewicz?
In Mr. Curtin's admirable translation, the Trilogy
covers over twenty-five hundred closely printed
pages; the <i>Knights of the Cross</i> over seven hundred
and fifty, <i>Children of the Soil</i> over six hundred and
fifty; <i>Without Dogma</i> (Englished by another hand)
has been silently so much abridged in translation
that we do not know what its actual length may
be. We do not rebel, because the next chapter
is invariably not a task, but a temptation; but when
we wake up with a start at the call <i>Finis</i>, which
magic word transfers us from the seventeenth to the
twentieth century, and contemplate the vast fabric
of our dream, we cannot help asking if there is any
law in the construction that requires so much
material. Gogol, in his astonishing romance, <i>Taras
Bulba</i>, which every lover of Sienkiewicz should
read, gives us the same impression of Vastness, in
a book Lilliputian in size. Nor is there any apparent
reason why the Polish narratives should
stop on the last page, nor indeed stop at all.
Combat succeeds combat, when in the midst of
the hurly-burly, the Master of the Show calls time.
It is his arbitrary will, rather than any inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
succession of events, that shuts off the scene: the
men might be fighting yet. This passion for mere
detail mars the first part of <i>With Fire and Sword</i>;
one cannot see the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>One reason for this immensity is the author's
desire to be historically accurate, the besetting sin
of many recent dramas and novels. Before beginning
to write, Sienkiewicz reads all the authorities
and documentary evidence he can find. The result
is plainly seen in the early pages of <i>With Fire and
Sword</i>, which read far more like a history than like
a work of fiction&mdash;note the striking contrast in
<i>Pan Michael</i>! The <i>Knights of the Cross</i> appeared
with maps. The topography of <i>Quo Vadis</i> was so
carefully prepared that it almost serves as a guide-book
to ancient Rome. Now the relation of History
to Fiction has never been better stated than by
Lessing: "The dramatist uses history, not because
it has happened, but because it has so happened
that he could scarcely find anything else
better adapted to his purpose." No work of fiction
has ever gained immortality by its historical accuracy.</p>

<p>Everyone notices that the works of Sienkiewicz
are Epics rather than Novels. Even bearing Fielding
clearly in mind, there is no better illustration
to be found in literary history. The Trilogy bears
the same relation to the wars of Poland that the
Iliad bears to the struggle at Troy. The scope and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
flow of the narrative, the power of the scenes, the
vast perspective, the portraits of individual heroes,
the impassioned poetry of the style&mdash;all these
qualities are of the Epic. The intense patriotism
is thrilling, and makes one envy the sensations of
native readers. And yet the reasons for the downfall
of Poland are made perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Is the <i>romanticist</i> Sienkiewicz an original writer?
In the narrow and strict sense of the word, I think
not. He is eclectic rather than original. He is
a skilful fuser of material, like Shakespeare. At
any rate, his most conspicuous virtue is not originality.
He has enormous force, a glorious imagination,
astonishing facility, and a remarkable power of making
pictures, both in panorama and in miniature;
but his work shows constantly the inspiration not
only of his historical authorities, but of previous
poets and novelists. Those who are really familiar
with the writings of Homer, Shakespeare, Scott,
and Dumas, will not require further comment on
this point. The influence of Homer is seen in the
constant similes, the epithets like "incomparable
bowman," and the stress laid on the deeds of individual
heroes; a thing quite natural in Homeric
warfare, but rather disquieting in the days of villainous
saltpetre. The three swordsmen in <i>With Fire
and Sword</i>&mdash;Pan Yan, Pan Podbienta, and Pan
Michael&mdash;infallibly remind us of Dumas's three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
guardsmen; and the great duel scenes in the same
story, and in the <i>Knights of the Cross</i>, are quite in
the manner of the Frenchman. Would that other
writers could employ their reminiscences to such
advantage! In the high colouring, in the management
of historical events, and in patriotic enthusiasm,
we cannot help thinking of Scott. But be the debt
to Dumas and to Scott as great as one pleases to
estimate, I am free to acknowledge that I find the
romances of the Pole more enthralling than those
of either or both of his two great predecessors.</p>

<p>With reference to the much-discussed character
of Zagloba, I confess I cannot join in the common
verdict that pronounces him a "new creation in
literature." Those who believe this delightful
person to be something new and original have simply
forgotten Falstaff. If one will begin all over again,
and read the two parts of <i>Henry IV</i>, and then take
a look at Zagloba, the author of his being is immediately
apparent. Zagloba is a Polish Falstaff,
an astonishingly clever imitation of the real thing.
He is old, white-haired, fat, a resourceful wit and
humorist, better at bottles than at battles, and yet
bold when policy requires: in every essential feature
of body and mind he resembles the immortal creation
of Shakespeare. Sienkiewicz <i>develops</i> him with
subtle skill and affectionate solicitude, even as
Dickens developed Mr. Pickwick; the Zagloba of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
<i>Pan Michael</i> is far sweeter and more mellow than
when we make his acquaintance in the first volume
of the Trilogy; but the last word for this character
is the word "original." The real triumph of Sienkiewicz
in the portrayal of the jester is in the fact
that he could imitate Falstaff without spoiling him,
for no other living writer could have done it. A
copy that can safely be placed alongside the original
implies art of a very high class. To see Zagloba
is to realise the truth of Falstaff's remark, "I am
not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is
in other men."</p>

<p>Sienkiewicz himself perhaps does not appreciate
how much he owes to Shakespeare, or possibly he
is a bit sensitive on the subject, for he explains,
"If I may be permitted to make a comparison,
I think that Zagloba is a better character than Falstaff.
At heart the old noble was a good fellow.
He would fight bravely when it became necessary,
whereas Shakespeare makes Falstaff a coward and
a poltroon."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> If the last two epithets were really
an accurate description of Falstaff, he would never
have conquered so many millions of readers.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In power of description on a large scale, Sienkiewicz
seems to take a place among the world's great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
masters of fiction. The bigger the canvas, the more
impressive he becomes. His pictures of the boundless
steppes by day and night, and in the varying
seasons of the year, leave permanent images in the
mind. Especially in huge battle scenes is his genius
resplendent. It is as if we viewed the whole drama
of blood from a convenient mountain peak. The
awful tumult gathers and breaks like some hideous
storm. So far as I know no writer has ever excelled
this Verestchagin of the pen except Tolstoi&mdash;and
Tolstoi's power lies more in the subjective side of
the horrors of war. The Russian's skill is more
intellectual, more psychological, of a really higher
order of art. For in the endeavour to make the
picture vivid, Sienkiewicz becomes at times merely
sensational. There is no excuse for his frequent
descent into loathsome and horrible detail. The
employment of human entrails as a necklace may
be historically accurate, but it is out of place in a
work of art. The minute description of the use of
the stake is another instance of the same tendency,
and the unspeakably horrid torture of Azya in <i>Pan
Michael</i> is a sad blot on an otherwise splendid
romance. The love of the physically horrible is
an unfortunate characteristic of our Polish novelist,
for it appears in <i>Quo Vadis</i> as well as in the Trilogy.
The greatest works appeal to the mind rather than
the senses. <i>Pan Michael</i> is a great book, not because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
it reeks with blood and abounds in hell's
ingenuity of pain, but because it presents the character
of a hero made perfect through suffering;
every sword-stroke develops his spirit as well as his
arm. Superfluous events, so frequent in the other
works, are here omitted; the story progresses steadily;
it is the most condensed and the most human book
in the Trilogy. Again, in <i>The Deluge</i>, the author's
highest skill is shown not in the portrayal of moving
accidents by flood and field, but in the regeneration
of Kmita. He passes through a long period of
slow moral gestation, which ultimately brings him
from darkness to light.</p>

<p>To non-Slavonic readers, who became acquainted
with Sienkiewicz through the Trilogy, it was a surprise
to discover that at home he was equally distinguished
as an exponent of modern realism. The acute
demand for anything and everything from his pen
led to the translation of <i>The Family of Polanyetski</i>,
rechristened in English (one hardly knows why)
<i>Children of the Soil</i>; this was preceded by the curious
psychological study, <i>Without Dogma</i>. It is extremely
fortunate that these two works have been
made accessible to English readers, for they display
powers that would not otherwise be suspected. It
is true that English novelists have shone in both
realism and romance: we need remember only
Defoe, Dickens, and Thackeray. But at the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
moment when we were all thinking of Sienkiewicz
as a reincarnation of Scott or Dumas, we were compelled
to revise previous estimates of his position
and abilities. Genius always refuses to be classified,
ticketed, or inventoried; just as you have got your
man "placed," or, to change the figure, have solemnly
and definitely ushered him to a seat in the second
row on the upper tier, you discover that he is much
bigger than or quite different from your definition
of him. Sienkiewicz is undoubtedly one of the
greatest living masters of the realistic novel. In the
two stories just mentioned above, the most minute
trivialities in human intercourse are set forth in a style
that never becomes trivial. He is as good at external
description as he is at psychological analysis.
He takes all human nature for his province. He
belongs not only to the "feel" school of novelists,
with Zola, but to the "thought" school, with Turgenev.
The workings of the human mind, as impelled
by all sorts of motives, ambitions, and passions,
make the subject for his examination. In the
Trilogy, he took an enormous canvas, and splashed
on myriads of figures; in <i>Without Dogma</i>, he puts
the soul of one man under the microscope. The
events in this man's life are mainly "transitions
from one state of spiritual experience to another."
Naturally the mirror selected is a diary, for <i>Without
Dogma</i> belongs to a school of literature illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
by such examples as the <i>Sorrows of Werther</i> and
<i>Amiel's Journal</i>. It must be remembered that we
have here a study primarily of the Slav character.
The hero cleverly diagnoses his own symptoms as
<i>Slave Improductivité</i>. He is perhaps puzzling to
the practical Philistine Anglo-Saxon: but not if one
has read Turgenev, Dostoievsky, or Gorky. Turgenev's
brilliant analysis of Rudin must stand for
all time as a perfect portrait of the educated Slav,
a person who fulfils the witty definition of a
Mugwump, "one who is educated beyond his capacity."
We have a similar character here, the conventional
conception of Hamlet, a man whose power
of reasoning overbalances his strength of will. He
can talk brilliantly on all kinds of intellectual topics,
but he cannot bring things to pass. He has a bad
case of <i>slave improductivité</i>. The very title, <i>Without
Dogma</i>, reveals the lack of conviction that ultimately
destroys the hero. He has absolutely no
driving power; as he expresses it, <i>he does not know</i>.
If one wishes to examine this sort of mind, extremely
common among the upper classes of Poles and
Russians, one cannot do better than read attentively
this book. Every futile impulse, every vain longing,
every idle day-dream, is clearly reflected. It
is a melancholy spectacle, but fascinating and
highly instructive. For it is not merely an individual,
but the national Slavonic character that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
revealed.</p>

<p>Sienkiewicz is not only a Romanticist and a
Realist&mdash;he is also a Moralist. The foundations
of his art are set deep in the bed-rock of moral ideas.
As Tolstoi would say, he has the right attitude
toward his characters. He believes that the Novel
should strengthen life, not undermine it; ennoble,
not defile it; for it is good tidings, not evil. "I
care not whether the word that I say pleases or not,
since I believe that I reflect the great urgent need
of the soul of humanity, which is crying for a change.
People must think according to the laws of logic.
And because they must also live, they want some
consolation on the road of life. Masters after the
manner of Zola give them only dissolution, chaos,
a disgust for life, and despair."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This is the signal
of a strong and healthy soul. The fact is, that at
heart Sienkiewicz is as stout a moralist as Tolstoi,
and with equal ardour recognises Christianity as
the world's best standard and greatest need. The
basis of the novel <i>Children of the Soil</i> is purely
Christian. The simple-hearted Marynia is married
to a man far superior to her in mental endowment
and training, as so often happens in Slavonic fiction;
she cannot follow his intellectual flights, and does
not even understand the processes of his mind.
She has no talent for metaphysical discussion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
no knowledge of modern science. But although her
education does not compare with that of her husband,
she has, without suspecting it, completely
mastered the art of life; for she is a devout and
sincere Christian, meek and lowly in heart. He
finally recognises that while he has more learning,
she has more wisdom; and when the book closes,
we see him a pupil at her feet. All his vain speculations
are overthrown by the power of religion
manifested in the purity, peace, and contentment
of his wife's daily life. And now he too&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>This idea is revealed positively in <i>Children of the
Soil</i>, and negatively in <i>Without Dogma</i>. The two
women, Marynia and Aniela, are very similar.
Aniela's intellect is elementary compared with that
of her brilliant lover, Leon Ploszowski. But her
Christian faith turns out to be a much better guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to conduct than his flux of metaphysics. She is a
good woman, and knows the difference between
right and wrong without having to look it up in
a book. When he urges her to a <i>liaison</i>, and overwhelms
her objections with a fine display of modern
dialectic, she concludes the debate by saying, "I
cannot argue with you, because you are so much
cleverer than I; but I know that what you want me
to do is wrong, and I will not do it."</p>

<p>We find exactly the same emphasis when we turn
to the historical romance <i>Quo Vadis</i>. The whole
story is a glorification of Christianity, of Christian
ethics and Christian belief. The despised Christians
have discovered the secret of life, which the culture
of Petronius sought in vain. It was hidden from
the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes.
The influence of Lygia on Vinicius is, with a totally
different environment, precisely the same as the
influence of Marynia on Pan Stanislav.</p>

<p>Sienkiewicz seems to have much the same Christian
conception of Love as that shown in so many
ways by Browning. Love is the <i>summum bonum</i>,
and every manifestation of it has something divine.
Love in all its forms appears in these Polish novels,
as it does in Browning, from the basest sensual
desire to the purest self-sacrifice. There is indeed
a streak of animalism in Sienkiewicz, which shows
in all his works; but, if we may believe him, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
merely one representation of the great passion,
which so largely controls life and conduct. Love,
says Sienkiewicz, with perhaps more force than
clearness, should be the foundation of all literature.
"L'amour&mdash;c'est un droit éternel, une force vitale,
c'est le génie&mdash;bienfaiteur de notre globe: l'harmonie.
Sienkiewicz croit que l'amour, ainsi compris,
est le fondement de la littérature polonaise&mdash;et
que cet amour devrait l'être pour toute la littérature."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Some light may be thrown on this statement
by a careful reading of <i>Pan Michael</i>.</p>

<p>Sienkiewicz is indeed a mighty man&mdash;someone
has ironically called him a literary blacksmith.
There is nothing decadent in his nature. Compared
with many English, German, and French writers,
who seem at times to express an anæmic and played-out
civilisation, he has the very exuberance of power
and an endless wealth of material. It is as if the
world were fresh and new. And he has not only
delighted us with the pageantry of chivalry, and with
the depiction of our complex modern civilisation,
he has for us also the stimulating influence of a
great moral force.</p>

<p class="center big">HERMANN SUDERMANN</p>


<p>Walking along Michigan Avenue in Chicago one
fine day, I stopped in front of the recently completed
hall devoted to music. On the façade of this building
had been placed five names, supposed to represent
the five greatest composers that the world
has thus far seen. It was worth while to pause a
moment and to reflect that those five men were
all Germans. Germany's contribution to music
is not only greater than that of any other nation,
it is probably greater than that of all the other countries
of the earth put together, and multiplied several
times. In many forms of literary art,&mdash;especially
perhaps in drama and in lyrical poetry,&mdash;Germany
has been eminent; and she has produced the greatest
literary genius since Shakespeare. To-day the
Fatherland remains the intellectual workshop of
the world; men and women flock thither to study
subjects as varied as Theology, Chemistry, Mathematics,
and Music. All this splendid achievement
in science and in culture makes poverty in the field
of prose fiction all the more remarkable. For the
fact is, that the total number of truly great world-novels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
written in the German language, throughout
its entire history, can be counted on the fingers of
one hand.</p>

<p>In the making of fiction, from the point of view
solely of quality, Germany cannot stand an instant's
comparison with Russia, whose four great novelists
have immensely enriched the world; nor with Great
Britain, where masterpieces have been produced
for nearly two hundred years; nor with France,
where the names of notable novels crowd into the
memory; and even America, so poor in literature
and in genuine culture, can show at least one romance
that stands higher than anything which has
come from beyond the Rhine. Germany has no
reason to feel ashamed of her barrenness in fiction,
so pre-eminent is she in many other and perhaps
nobler forms of art. But it is interesting to enquire
for a moment into possible causes of this phenomenon,
and to see if we can discover why Teutonic fiction
is, relatively speaking, so bad.</p>

<p>One dominant fault in most German novels is a
lack of true proportion. The principle of selection,
which differentiates a painting from a photograph,
and makes the artist an Interpreter instead of a
Recorder, has been forgotten or overlooked. The
high and holy virtue of Omission should be cultivated
more sedulously. The art of leaving out is
the art that produces the real illusion&mdash;where, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the omission of unessential details, things that are
salient can be properly emphasised. And what
German novels lack is emphasis. This cannot
be obtained by merely spacing the letters in descriptions
and in conversations; it can be reached
only by remembering that prose fiction is as truly
an art form as a Sonata. Instead of novels, the weary
reader gets long and tiresome biographies of rather
unimportant persons; people whom we should
not in the least care to know in real life. We follow
them dejectedly from the cradle to the grave. Matters
of no earthly consequence either to the reader,
to the hero, or to the course of the plot, are given
as much prominence as great events. In <i>Jörn Uhl</i>,
to take a recent illustration, the novel is positively
choked by trivial detail. Despite the enormous
vogue of this story, it does not seem destined to live.
It will fall by its own weight.</p>

<p>Another great fault is an excess of sentimentality.
For the Germans, who delight in destroying old
faiths of humanity, and who remorselessly hammer
away at the shrines where we worship in history
and religion, are, notwithstanding their iconoclasm,
the most sentimental people in the world. Many
second-and third-rate German novels are ruined
for an Anglo-Saxon reader by a lush streak of sentimental
gush, a curious blemish in so intellectual
and sceptical a race. This excess of soft material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
appears in a variety of forms; but to take one common
manifestation of it, I should say that the one
single object that has done more than anything else
to weaken and to destroy German fiction, is the
Moon. The Germans are, by nature and by training,
scientific; and what their novels need is not the
examination of literary critics, but the thoughtful
attention of astronomers. The Moon is overworked,
and needs a long rest. An immense number of
pages are illumined by its chaste beams, for this
satellite is both active and ubiquitous. It behaves,
it must be confessed, in a dramatic manner, but in
a way hopelessly at variance with its methodical
and orderly self. In other words, the Moon, in
German fiction, is not astronomical, but decorative.
I have read some stories where it seems to rise on
almost every page, and is invariably full. When
Stevenson came to grief on the Moon in <i>Prince
Otto</i>, he declared that the next time he wrote a novel,
he should use an almanac. He unwittingly laid
his finger on a weak spot in German fiction. The
almanac is, after all, what is most sorely needed.
Even Herr Sudermann, for whom we entertain the
highest respect, places in <i>Es War</i> a young crescent
Moon in the eastern sky! But it is in his story,
<i>Der Katzensteg</i>, that the lunar orb plays its heaviest
rôle. It rises so constantly that after a time the
very words "<i>der Mond</i>" get on one's nerves. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
climax, when the lover looks down on the stream,
he there beholds the dead body of his sweetheart.
By some scientific process, "unknown to me and
which 'twere well to know," she is floating on her
back in the water, while the Moon illumines her face,
leaving the rest of her remains in darkness. This
constitutes a striking picture; and is also of material
assistance to the man in locating the whereabouts
of the girl. He descends, rescues her from the
flood, and digs a grave in which to bury her. The
Moon actively and dramatically takes part in this
labour. Finally, he has lowered the corpse into
the bottom of the cavity. The Moon now shines
into the grave in such a manner that the dead
woman's face is bright with its rays, whereas the
rest of her body and the walls of the tomb are in
obscurity. This phenomenon naturally makes a
powerful impression on the mourner's mind.</p>

<p>If such things can happen in the works of a writer
like Sudermann, one can easily imagine the reckless
behaviour of the Moon in the common run of German
fiction. The Moon, in fact, is in German novels
what the calcium light is in American melodrama.
If one "assists" at a performance of, let us say, <i>No
Wedding Bells for Her</i>, and can take his eye a
moment from the stage, he may observe up in the
back gallery a person working the calcium light,
and directing its powerful beams in such a fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
that no matter where the heroine moves, they dwell
exclusively on her face, so that we may contemplate
her features convulsed with emotion. Now in <i>Der
Katzensteg</i>, the patient Moon follows the heroine
about with much the same assiduity, and accuracy
of aim. Possibly Herr Sudermann, since the composition
of that work, has really consulted an
almanac; for in <i>Das hohe Lied</i>, the Moon is practically
ignored, and never gets a fair start. Toward
the end, I felt sure that it would appear, and
finally, when I came to the words, "The weary disk
of the full moon (<i>matte Vollmondscheibe</i>) hung
somewhere in the dark sky," I exclaimed, "Art
thou there, truepenny?"&mdash;but the next sentence
showed that the author was playing fast and loose
with his old friend. "It was the illuminated
clock of a railway-station." Can Sudermann have
purposely set a trap for his moon-struck constituency?</p>

<p>From the astronomical point of view, I have seldom
read a novel that contained so much moonlight as
<i>Der Katzensteg</i>, and I have never read one that
contained so little as <i>Das hohe Lied</i>. Perhaps
Sudermann is now quietly protesting against what
he himself may regard as a national calamity, for
it is little less than that. Be this as it may, the lack
of proportion and the excess of sentimentality are
two great evils that have militated against the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
success of German fiction.</p>

<p>Hermann Sudermann was born at a little village
in East Prussia, near the Russian frontier. The
natal landscape is dull, depressing, gloomy, and the
skies are low and threatening. The clouds return
after the rain. Dame Care has spread her grey
wings over the flat earth, and neither the scenery
nor the quality of the air are such as to inspire hope
and vigour. The boy's parents were desperately
poor, and the bitter struggles with poverty so frequently
described in his novels are reminiscent of
early experiences. In the beautiful and affectionate
verses, which constitute the dedication to his father
and mother, and which are placed at the beginning
of <i>Frau Sorge</i>, these privations of the Sudermann
household are dwelt on with loving tenderness.
At the age of fourteen, the child was forced to leave
school, and was apprenticed to a chemist&mdash;something
that recalls chapters in the lives of Keats and
of Ibsen. But, like most boys who really long for
a good education, Sudermann obtained it; he
continued his studies in private, and later returned
to school at Tilsit. In 1875 he attended the University
at Königsberg, and in 1877 migrated to the
University of Berlin. His first impulse was to become
a teacher, and he spent several years in a wide
range of studies in philosophy and literature. Then
he turned to journalism, and edited a political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
weekly. He finally forsook journalism for literature,
and for the last twenty years he has been known in
every part of the intellectual world.</p>

<p>Like Mr. J. M. Barrie, Signor D'Annunzio, and
other contemporaries, Sudermann has achieved high
distinction both as a novelist and as a dramatist.
Indeed, one of the signs of the times is the recruiting
of playwrights from the ranks of trained experts
in prose fiction. It may perhaps be regarded as
one more evidence of the approaching supremacy
of the Drama, which many literary prophets have
foretold. After he had published a small collection
of "Zwanglose Geschichten," called <i>Im Zwielicht</i>,
Sudermann issued his first real novel, <i>Dame Care</i>
(<i>Frau Sorge</i>). This was followed by two tales
bound together under the heading <i>Geschwister</i>, one
of them being the morbidly powerful story, <i>The Wish</i>
(<i>Der Wunsch</i>). Soon after came <i>Der Katzensteg</i>,
translated into English with the title, <i>Regina</i>. Then,
after a surprisingly short interval, came his first play,
<i>Die Ehre</i> (1889), which appeared in the same year
as his rival Hauptmann's first drama, <i>Vor Sonnenaufgang</i>.
<i>Die Ehre</i> created a tremendous sensation,
and Sudermann was excitedly read and
discussed far beyond the limits of his native land.
He reached a wild climax of popularity a few years
later with his play <i>Heimat</i> (English version <i>Magda</i>),
which has been presented by the greatest actresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
in the world, and is familiar to everybody. With
the exception of the long novel, <i>Es War</i> (English
translation, <i>The Undying Past</i>), which appeared
in 1894, Sudermann devoted himself exclusively
to the stage for almost twenty years, and most of
us believed he had definitely abandoned novel-writing.
From 1889 to 1909, he produced nineteen
plays, nearly every one of them successful. Then
last year he astonished everybody by publishing
a novel of over six hundred closely printed pages,
called <i>Das hohe Lied</i>, translated into English as
<i>The Song of Songs</i>. This has had an enormous
success, and for 1908-1909, is the best selling work
of fiction in the large cities of Germany.</p>

<p>The immense vogue of his early plays had much
to do with the wide circulation of his previously
published novels. Despite the now universally
acknowledged excellence of <i>Frau Sorge</i>, it attracted,
at the time of its appearance, very little attention.
It is going beyond the facts to say with
one German critic that "it dropped stillborn from
the press"; but it did not give the author anything
like the fame he deserved. After the first night of
<i>Die Ehre</i>, the public became inquisitive. A search
was made for everything the new author had written,
and the two novels <i>Frau Sorge</i>, and the very recent
<i>Katzensteg</i>, were fairly pounced upon. The small
stock on hand was immediately exhausted, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
presses poured forth edition after edition. At first
<i>Der Katzensteg</i> received the louder tribute of praise;
it was hailed by many otherwise sane critics as the
greatest work of fiction that Germany had ever
produced. But after the tumult and the shouting
died, the people recognised the superiority of the
former novel. To-day <i>Der Katzensteg</i> is, comparatively
speaking, little read, and one seldom hears
it mentioned. <i>Frau Sorge</i>, on the other hand, has
not only attained more editions than any other work,
either play or novel, by its author, but it bears the
signs that mark a classic. It is one of the very few
truly great German novels, and it is possible that
this early written story will survive everything that
Sudermann has since produced, which is saying a
good deal. It looks like a fixed star.</p>

<p>Sudermann's four novels, <i>Frau Sorge</i>, <i>Der Katzensteg</i>,
<i>Es War</i>, and <i>Das hohe Lied</i>, show a steady
progression in Space as well as in Time. The first
is the shortest; the second is larger; the third is
a long book; the fourth is a leviathan. If novelists
were heard for their much speaking, the order of
merit in this output would need no comment. But
the first of these is almost as superior in quality as
it is inferior in size. When the author prepared
it for the press, he was an absolutely unknown
man. Possibly he put more work on it than went
into the other books, for it apparently bears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
marks of careful revision. It is a great exception to
the ordinary run of German novels in its complete
freedom from superfluous and clogging detail.
Turgenev used to write his stories originally at great
length, and then reduce them to a small fraction
of their original bulk, before offering them to the
public. We thus receive the quintessence of his
thought and of his art. Now <i>Frau Sorge</i> has apparently
been subjected to some such process. Much
of the huge and varied cargo of ideas, reflections,
comments, and speculations carried by the regulation
German freight-novel of heavy draught, has
here been jettisoned. Then the craft itself has been
completely remodelled, and the final result is a thing
of grace and beauty.</p>

<p><i>Frau Sorge</i> is an admirable story in its absolute
unity, in its harmonious development, and in its
natural conclusion. I do not know of any other
German novel that has a more attractive outline.
It ought to serve as an example to its author's countrymen.</p>

<p>It is in a way an anatomy of melancholy. It is
written throughout in the minor key, and the atmosphere
of melancholy envelops it with as much
natural charm as though it were a beautiful piece
of music. The book is profoundly sad, without any
false sentiment and without any revolting coarseness.
It is as far removed from the silly sentimentality
so common in Teutonic fiction, as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
from the filth of Zola or of Gorky. The deep melancholy
of the story is as natural to it as a cloudy
sky. The characters live and move and have their
being in this grey medium, which fits them like a
garment; just as in the early tales of Björnson we
feel the strong sunshine and the sharp air. The early
environment of the young author, the depressing
landscape of his boyhood days, the daily fight with
grim want in his father's house&mdash;all these elements
are faithfully reflected here, and lend their colour
to the narrative. And this surrounding melancholy,
though it overshadows the whole book, is made to
serve an artistic purpose. It contrasts favourably
with Ibsen's harsh bitterness, with Gorky's maudlin
dreariness, and with the hysterical outbursts of pessimism
from the manikins who try to see life from
the mighty shoulders of Schopenhauer. At the very
heart of the work we find no sentiment of revolt
against life, and no cry of despair, but true tenderness
and broad sympathy. It is the clear expression
of a rich, warm nature.</p>

<p>The story is realistic, with a veil of Romanticism.
The various scenes of the tale seem almost photographically
real. The daily life on the farm, the
struggles with the agricultural machine, the peat-bogs,
the childish experiences at school, the brutality
of the boys, the graphic picture of the funeral,&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
would not be out of place in a genuine experimental
novel. But we see everything through an imaginative
medium, like the impalpable silver-grey mist on
the paintings of Andrea del Sarto. The way in
which the difficult conception of <i>Frau Sorge</i>&mdash;part
woman, part vague abstraction&mdash;is managed,
reminds one in its shadowy nature of Nathaniel
Hawthorne. This might have been done clumsily,
as in a crude fairy-tale, but it exhibits the most
subtle art. The first description of Frau Sorge by
the mother, the boy's first glimpse of the supernatural
woman, his father's overcoat, the Magdalene
in church, the flutter of Frau Sorge's wings,&mdash;all
this gives us a realistic story, and yet takes us into
the borderland between the actual and the unknown.
From one point of view we have a plain narrative
of fact; from another an imaginative poem, and at
the end we feel that both have been marvellously
blended.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the style gives the novel a high
rank in German prose. It has that naïve quality
wherein the Germans so greatly excel writers in
other languages. It is a surprising fact that this
tongue, so full of difficulties for foreigners, and
which seems often so confused and involved, can,
in the hands of a master, be made to speak like a
little child. The literary style of <i>Frau Sorge</i> is
naïve without ever being trivial or absurd. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
pleasant to observe, by the way, that to some extent
this book is filling the place in American educational
programmes of German that <i>L'Abbé Constantin</i>
has for so long a time occupied in early studies of
French. Both novels are masterpieces of simplicity.</p>

<p>But what we remember the most vividly, years
after we have finished this story, is not its scenic
background, nor its unearthly charm, nor the grace
of its style; it is the character and temperament of
the boy-hero. It is the first, and possibly the best,
of Sudermann's remarkable psychological studies.
The whole interest is centred in young Paul. He is
not exactly the normal type of growing boy,&mdash;compare
him with Tom Sawyer!&mdash;but because he is not
ordinary, it does not follow that he is unnatural.
To many thoroughly respectable Philistine readers,
he may appear not only abnormal, but impossible;
but the book was not intended for Philistines. I
believe that this boy is absolutely true to life, though
I do not recall at this moment any other novel where
this particular kind of youth occupies the centre of
the stage.</p>

<p>For <i>Frau Sorge</i> is a careful study and analysis
of <i>bashfulness</i>, a characteristic that causes more
exquisite torture to many boys and girls than is
commonly recognised. Many of us, when we laugh
at a boy's bashfulness, are brutal, when we mean to
be merely jocular. Paul is intensely self-conscious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
He is not at all like a healthy, practical, objective
child, brought up in a large family, and surrounded
by the noisy progeny of neighbours. His life is
perforcedly largely subjective. He would give anything
could he associate with schoolmates with the
ease that makes a popular boy sure of his welcome.
His accursed timidity makes him invariably show
his most awkward and unattractive side. He is not
in the least a <i>Weltkind</i>. He has none of the coarseness
and none of the clever shirking of work and
study so characteristic of the perfectly normal small
boy. He does his duty <i>without any reservations</i>,
and without understanding why. The narrative of
his mental life is deeply pathetic. It is impossible
to read the book without a lump in the throat.</p>

<p>Paul is finally saved from himself by the redeeming
power of love. The little heroine Elsbeth is
shadowy,&mdash;a merely conventional picture of hair,
complexion, and eyes,&mdash;but she is, after all, <i>das
Ewigweibliche</i>, and draws Paul upward and onward.
She rescues him from the Slough of Despond. There
is no touch of cynicism here. Sudermann shows us
the healing power of a good woman's heart.</p>

<p>The next novel, <i>Der Katzensteg</i>, is more pretentious
than <i>Frau Sorge</i>, but not nearly so fine a book. It
abounds in dramatic scenes, and glows with fierce
passion. It seems more like a melodrama than a
story, and it is not surprising that its author immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
discovered&mdash;perhaps in the very composition
of this romance&mdash;his genius for the stage.
It is a historical novel, but the chief interest, as always
in Sudermann, is psychological. The element of
Contrast&mdash;so essential to true drama, and which
is so strikingly employed in <i>Die Ehre</i>, <i>Sodoms Ende</i>,
<i>Heimat</i>, and <i>Johannes</i>&mdash;is the mainspring of <i>Der
Katzensteg</i>. We have here the irrepressible conflict
between the artificial and the natural. The
heroine of the story is a veritable child of nature,
with absolutely elemental passions, as completely
removed from civilisation as a wild beast. She was
formerly the mistress of the hero's father, and for
a long time is naturally regarded with loathing by
the son. But she transfers her dog-like fidelity from
the dead parent to the morbid scion of the house.
The more cruelly the young man treats her, the
deeper becomes her love for him. Nor does he at
first suspect the hold she has on his heart. He
imagines himself to be in love with the pastor's
daughter in the village, who has been brought up
like a hothouse plant. This simpering, affected
girl, who has had all the advantages of careful
nurture and education, is throughout the story contrasted
with the wild flower, Regina. The contrast
is thorough&mdash;mental, moral, physical. The
educated girl has no real mind; she has only accomplishments.
Her morality has nothing to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
with the heart; it is a bundle of conventions. And
finally, while Regina has a magnificent, voluptuous
physique, the hero discovers&mdash;by the light of the
moon&mdash;that the lady of his dreams is too thin!
This is unendurable. He rushes away from the
town to the heights where stands his lonely dwelling,
cursing himself for his folly in being so long blind
to the wonderful charm and devotion of the passionate
girl who, he feels sure, is waiting for him. He
hastens on the very wings of love, wild with his
new-found happiness. But the very fidelity of the
child of nature has caused her death. She stood
out on the bridge&mdash;<i>der Katzensteg</i>&mdash;to warn her
lover of his danger. There she is shot by her drunken
father, and the impatient lover sees her dead body
in the stream below.</p>

<p>Now he has leisure to reflect on what a fool he
has been. He sees how much nobler are natural
passions than artificial conventions. Regina had
lived "on the other side of good and evil," knowing
and caring nothing for the standards of society.
The entire significance of the novel is summed up
in this paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"And as he thought and pondered, it seemed to him as
if the clouds which separate the foundations of human being
from human consciousness" (that is, things as they are from
our conceptions of them,&mdash;<i>den Boden des menschlichen Seins
vom menschlichen Bewusstsein</i>) "were dispersed, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
saw a space deeper than men commonly see, into the depths
of the unconscious. That which men call Good and Bad,
moved restless in the clouds around the surface; below, in
dreaming strength, lay the <i>Natural</i> (<i>das Natürliche</i>). 'Whom
Nature has blessed,' he said to himself, 'him she lets safely
grow in her dark depths and allows him to struggle boldly
toward the light, without the clouds of Wisdom and Error
surrounding and bewildering him.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>But there is nothing new or original in this doctrine,
however daring it may be. One can find it all in
Nietzsche and in Rousseau. The best thing about
the novel is that it once more illustrates Sudermann's
sympathy for the outcast and the despised.</p>

<p>An extraordinarily powerful study in morbid
psychology is shown in one of his short stories,
called <i>Der Wunsch</i>. The tale is told backward.
It begins with the discovery of a horrible suicide,
the explanation of which is furnished to the
prostrated lover by the dead woman's manuscript.
A man and his wife, at first happily married,
encounter the dreadful obstacles of poverty and
disease; the fatal illness of his wife plunges the
husband into a hard, bitter melancholy. From this
he is partially saved by the appearance of his wife's
younger sister on the scene, who comes to take care
of the sick woman. The close companionship of
the two, previously fond of each other, and now
united daily by their care of the invalid, results in
love; but both are absolutely loyal to the suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
wife. They cannot help thinking, however, of the
wonderful happiness that might be theirs, were the
man free; nevertheless, they do everything possible
to solace the last hours of the woman for whom they
feel an immense compassion. One night, as the
sister watches at the bedside, and gazes on the face
of her sister, she suddenly feels the uncontrollable
and fatal <i>wish</i>&mdash;"Would that she might die!"
She is so smitten with remorse that after the death
of the invalid she commits suicide. For although
her wish had nothing to do with this event, she
nevertheless regards herself as a murderer, and goes
to self-execution. The physician remarks that this
psychological <i>wish</i> is not uncommon; that during
his professional services he has often seen it legibly
written on the faces of relatives by the bedside&mdash;sometimes
actuated by avarice, sometimes by other
forms of personal greed.</p>

<p>The next regular novel, <i>Es War</i>, is the study of a
past sin on a man's character, temperament, and
conduct. The hero, Leo, has committed adultery
with the wife of a disagreeable husband, and, being
challenged by the latter to a duel, has killed him.
Thus having broken two of the commandments, he
departs for South America, where for four years
he lives a joyous, care-free, savage existence, with
murder and sensuality a regular part of the day's
work. It is perhaps a little hard on South America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that Leo could live there in such liberty and return
to Germany unscathed by the arm of the law; but
this is essential to the story. He returns a kind of
Superman, rejoicing in his magnificent health and
absolutely determined to repent nothing. He will
not allow the past to obscure his happiness. But
unfortunately his friend Ulrich, whom he has loved
since childhood with an affection passing the love of
women, has married the guilty widow, in blissful
unconsciousness of his friend's guilt. And here the
story opens. It is a long, depressing, but intensely
interesting tale. At the very close, when it seems
that wholesale tragedy is inevitable, the clouds lift,
and Leo, who has found the Past stronger than he,
regains something of the cheerfulness that characterises
his first appearance in the narrative.
Nevertheless <i>es war</i>; the Past cannot be lightly
tossed aside or forgotten. It comes near wrecking
the lives of every important character in the novel.
Yet the idea at the end seems to be that although
sin entails fearful punishment, and the scars can
never be obliterated, it is possible to triumph over it
and find happiness once more. The most beautiful
and impressive thing in <i>Es War</i> is the friendship
between the two men&mdash;so different in temperament
and so passionately devoted to each other. A large
group of characters is splendidly kept in hand, and
each is individual and clearly drawn. One can never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
forget the gluttonous, wine-bibbing Parson, who
comes eating and drinking, but who is a terror to
publicans and sinners.</p>

<p>Last year appeared <i>Das hohe Lied</i>, which, although
it lacks the morbid horror of much of Sudermann's
work, is the most pessimistic book he has
ever written. The irony of the title is the motive
of the whole novel. Between the covers of this
thick volume we find the entire detailed life-history
of a woman. She passes through much debauchery,
and we follow her into many places where we should
hesitate to penetrate in real life. But the steps in
her degradation are not put in, as they so often are
in Guy de Maupassant, merely to lend spice to the
narrative; every event has a definite influence on
the heroine's character. The story, although very
long, is strikingly similar to that in a recent successful
American play, <i>The Easiest Way</i>. Lilly
Czepanek is not naturally base or depraved. The
manuscript roll of her father's musical composition,
<i>Das hohe Lied</i>, which she carries with her from
childhood until her final submission to circumstances,
and which saves her body from suicide but
not her soul from death, is emblematic of the <i>élan</i>
which she has in her heart. With the best intentions
in the world, with noble, romantic sentiments,
with a passionate desire to be a rescuing angel to
the men and women whom she meets, she gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
sinks in the mire, until, at the end, her case is hopeless.
She struggles desperately, but each struggle
finds her stock of resistance reduced. She always
ends by taking the easiest way. Like a person in
a quicksand, every effort to escape sinks the body
deeper; or, like a drowning man, the more he raises
his hands to heaven, the more speedy is his destruction.
Much of Lilly's degradation is caused by what she
believes to be an elevating altruistic impulse. And
when she finally meets the only man in her whole
career who respects her in his heart, who really
means well by her, and whose salvation she can
accomplish along with her own,&mdash;one single evening,
where she begins with the best of intentions
and with a sincere effort toward a higher plane,
results in complete damnation. Then, like the
heroine in <i>The Easiest Way</i>, she determines to commit
suicide, and really means to do it. But the same
weakness that has made it hitherto impossible for
her to triumph over serious obstacles, prevents her
from taking this last decisive step. As she hears
the splash of her talisman in the cold, dark water,
she realises that she is not the stuff of which heroines
are made, either in life or in death.</p>

<blockquote><p>"And as she heard that sound, then she knew instantly
that she would <i>never</i> do it.&mdash;No indeed! Lilly Czepanek
was <i>no</i> Heroine. <i>No</i> martyr of her love was Lilly Czepanek.
No Isolde, who in the determination not to be, sees the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
self-assertion. She was only a poor brittle, crushed, broken
thing, who must drag along through her days as best she can."</p></blockquote>

<p>And with this realisation she goes wearily back to
a rich lover she had definitely forsaken, knowing
that in saving her life she has now lost it for ever.</p>

<p>This is the last page of the story, but unfortunately
it does not end here. Herr Sudermann has chosen
to add one paragraph after the word "<i>Schluss</i>." By
this we learn that in the spring of the following
year the aforesaid rich lover <i>marries</i> Lilly, and takes
her on a bridal trip to Italy, which all her life had
been in her dreams the celestial country. She is
thus saved from the awful fate of the streets, which
during the whole book had loomed threatening in
the distance. But this ending leaves us completely
bewildered and depressed. It seems to imply that,
after all, these successive steps in moral decline do
not make much difference, one way or the other;
for at the very beginning of her career she could
not possibly have hoped for any better material fate
than this. The reader not only feels cheated; he
feels that the moral element in the story, which
through all the scenes of vice has been made clear,
is now laughed at by the author. This is why I call
the book the most pessimistic of all Sudermann's
writings. A novel may take us through woe and
sin, and yet not produce any impression of cynicism;
but one that makes a careful, serious study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of subtle moral decay through over six hundred
pages, and then implies at the end that the distinction
between vice and virtue is, after all, a matter
of no consequence, leaves an impression for which
the proverbial "bad taste in the mouth" is utterly
inadequate to describe. Some years ago, Professor
Heller, in an admirable book on Modern German
Literature, remarked, in a comparison between
Hauptmann and Sudermann, that the former has
no working theory of life, which the latter possessed.
That Hauptmann's dramas offer no solution, merely
giving sordid wretchedness; while Sudermann shows
the conquest of environment by character. Or, as
Mr. Heller puts it, there is the contrast between
the "driving and the drifting." I think this distinction
in the main will justify itself to anyone who
makes a thoughtful comparison of the work of these
two remarkable men. Despite the depreciation
of Sudermann and the idolatry of Hauptmann, an
attitude so fashionable among German critics at
present, I believe that the works of the former have
shown a stronger grasp of life. But the final paragraph
of <i>Das hohe Lied</i> is a staggering blow to
those of us who have felt that Sudermann had some
kind of a <i>Weltanschauung</i>. It is like Chopin's
final movement in his great Sonata; mocking laughter
follows the solemn tones of the Funeral March.</p>

<p>Up to this last bad business, <i>Das hohe Lied</i> exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
that extraordinary power of psychological
analysis that we have come to expect from Sudermann.
Lilly, apart from her personal beauty, is not,
after all, an interesting girl; her mind is thoroughly
shallow and commonplace. Nor are the numerous
adventures through which she passes particularly
interesting. And yet the long book is by no means
dull, and one reads it with steady attention. The
reason for this becomes clear, after some reflexion.
Not only are we absorbed by the contemplation of
so masterly a piece of mental analysis, but what
interests us most is the constant attempt of Lilly
to analyse herself. We often wonder how people
appear to themselves. The unspoken dialogues
between Lilly and her own soul are amazingly well
done. She is constantly surprised by herself, constantly
bewildered by the fact that what she thought
was one set of motives, turns out to be quite otherwise.
All this comes to a great climax in the scene
late at night when she writes first one letter, then
another&mdash;each one meaning to be genuinely confessional.
Each letter is to give an absolutely faithful
account of her life, with a perfectly truthful depiction
of her real character. Now the two letters
are so different that in one she appears to be a low-lived
adventuress, and in the other a noble woman,
deceived through what is noblest in her. Finally
she tears both up, for she realises that although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
each letter gives the facts, neither tells the truth.
And then she sees that the truth cannot be told;
that life is far too complex to be put into language.</p>

<p>In the attempts of German critics years ago to
"classify" Sudermann, he was commonly placed
in one of the three following groups. Many insisted
that he was merely a Decadent, whose pleasure
it was to deal in unhealthy social problems. That
his interest in humanity was pathological. Others
held that he was a fierce social Reformer, a kind of
John the Baptist, who wished to reconstruct modern
society along better lines, and who was therefore
determined to make society realise its own rottenness.
He was primarily a Satirist, not a Decadent.
Professor Calvin Thomas quoted (without approbation)
Professor Litzmann of Bonn, who said that
Sudermann was "a born satirist, not one of the tame
sort who only tickle and scratch, but one of the
stamp of Juvenal, who swings his scourge with fierce
satisfaction so that the blood starts from the soft,
voluptuous flesh." A reading of <i>Das hohe Lied</i>
will convince anyone that Sudermann, wherever
he is, is not among the prophets. Finally, there
were many critics who at the very start recognised
Sudermann as primarily an artist, who chooses to
paint the aspects of life that interest him. This
is undoubtedly the true viewpoint. We may regret
that he prefers to analyse human characters in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
morbid and abnormal development, but that, after
all, is his affair, and we do not have to read him
unless we wish to. Professor Thomas, in an admirable
article on <i>Das Glück im Winkel</i>, contributed
in 1895 to the New York <i>Nation</i>, said, "Sudermann
is a man of the world, a psychologist, and an artist,
not a voice crying in the wilderness. The immortality
of Juvenal or Jeremiah would not be to
his taste." It is vain to quarrel with the direction
taken by genius; however much we may deplore its
course. Sudermann is one of the greatest, if not
the greatest, of Germany's living writers, and every
play or novel from his pen contains much material
for serious thought.</p>

<p class="center big">ALFRED OLLIVANT</p>


<p>In the month of September, 1898, there appeared
in America a novel with the attractive title, <i>Bob,
Son of Battle</i>. Unheralded by author's fame or by
the blare of advertisement, it was at first unnoticed;
but in about a twelvemonth everybody was talking
about it. It became one of the "best sellers";
unlike its companions, it has not vanished with
the snows of yesteryear. At this moment it is being
read and reread all over the United States. I do
not believe there is a single large town in our country
where the book is unknown, or where a reference
to it fails to bring to the faces of intelligent people
that glow of reminiscent delight aroused by the
memory of happy hours passed in the world of imagination.
It seemed so immensely superior to the
ordinary run of new novels, that we gazed with
pardonable curiosity at the unfamiliar signature on
the title-page. Who was this writer who knew so
much of the nature of dogs and men? Where had
he found that extraordinarily vivid style, and what
experiences had he passed through that gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
his subtle insight into character? But all that we
could then discover was that Alfred Ollivant was
an Englishman, and that <i>Bob</i> was his first novel.
We decided that he must have lived long, observed
all kinds of dogs, and a large variety of men, women,
and children; and that for some reason best known
to himself he had chosen to print nothing until he
had descended into the vale of years. For only the
other day we were not surprised to find that <i>Joseph
Vance</i> was the winter fruit of a man nearly seventy;
that book at any rate was the expression of a man
who had had life, and had it abundantly.</p>

<p>Our astonishment was keen indeed when we learned
that the author of <i>Bob</i> was a boy just out of his
teens, who had written his wonderful book in horizontal
pain and weakness. He had entered the
army, receiving his commission as a cavalry officer
in 1893, at the age of nineteen; a few weeks after
this event, a fall from his horse injured his spine,
previously affected by some mysterious malady;
this accident abruptly checked his chosen military
career, and made him a man of letters. Literature
owes a great deal to enforced idleness, whether the
writer be sick or in prison. The wind bloweth
where it listeth; and we perceived once more that
genius does not always accompany good health,
or maturity, or ambition; it seems to select with
absolute caprice the individuals through whom it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
speaks. And so this first-born child of the brain
was delivered, like human infants, on a bed of
suffering; being, to complete the analogy, none
the less healthy on that account. The book was
begun in 1894, when the author was twenty years
old; during intervals of physical capacity in 1895
and 1896, it was continued, and was submitted to
the publishers in 1897.</p>

<p>It was to have been published in the autumn,
but the London firm decided to postpone its appearance
one year. The author employed these
months in completely rewriting the story, which
he had named <i>Owd Bob</i>. Meanwhile, the New
York publishers, who had a copy of the original
manuscript, fearing that the title <i>Owd Bob</i> lacked
magnetism, wisely rechristened it <i>Bob, Son of
Battle</i>. And so, in September, 1898, the novel in
its first form, but with a new name, was printed
in America; simultaneously in England it appeared
in a new form, but with the old name. In other
words, the London first edition, <i>Owd Bob</i>, is a
thoroughly revised version of the American first
edition, <i>Bob, Son of Battle</i>, although they were
published at the same time. It does not seem as
though the author could have improved a book that
so completely satisfies us as it stands; and Americans,
to whom <i>Owd Bob</i> is unknown, may not believe
that it can be superior to <i>Bob, Son of Battle</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Nevertheless it is. The two versions are of course
alike in general features of the plot and in outline;
but no one who has read both can hesitate an instant.
One has only to compare the manner in which Red
Wull made his <i>début</i> in America with the chapter
where he first appears (in a totally different way)
in the English edition, to see how clearly second
thoughts were best.</p>

<p>And yet, despite the enormous popularity of <i>Bob,
Son of Battle</i> in the United States, and despite the
fact that Englishmen had the opportunity to read
the story in a still finer form, it has not until very
recently made any impression on British readers
or on London critics. Is it possible that a book,
like a dog, may be killed by a bad name? The
novel was written by an Englishman, the scenes were
laid in Britain, it dealt with manners and customs
peculiarly English, and it was aimed directly at
an English public. And yet, for nearly ten years
after its publication, <i>Owd Bob</i> remained in obscurity.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
But its day is coming, and the prophet will yet receive
honour in his own country. In 1908 it was
reprinted in a seven-pence edition, of which fifty
thousand copies have already seen the light. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
is nothing to the American circulation; but it is
promising. Bearing in mind the futility of literary
prophecy, I still believe that the day will come when
<i>Owd Bob</i> will be generally recognised as belonging
to English literature.</p>

<p>The splendid fidelity and devotion of the dog to
his master have certainly been in part repaid by
men of letters in all stages of the world's history.
A valuable essay might be written on the dog's
contributions to literature; in the poetry of the East,
hundreds of years before Christ, the poor Indian
insisted that his four-footed friend should accompany
him into eternity. We know that this bit of Oriental
pathos impressed Pope:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2q">"But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His faithful dog shall bear him company."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the most profoundly affecting incidents in
the <i>Odyssey</i> is the recognition of the ragged Ulysses
by the noble old dog, who dies of joy. During the
last half-century, since the publication of Dr. John
Brown's <i>Rab and his Friends</i> (1858), the dog has
approached an apotheosis. Among innumerable
sketches and stories with canine heroes may be
mentioned Bret Harte's brilliant portrait of <i>Boonder</i>;
Maeterlinck's essay on dogs; Richard Harding
Davis's <i>The Bar Sinister</i>; Stevenson's whimsical
comments on <i>The Character of Dogs</i>; Kipling's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<i>Garm</i>; and Jack London's initial success, <i>The Call
of the Wild</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But all these latter-day pamphlets,
good as they are, fail to reach the excellence
of <i>Bob, Son of Battle</i>. It is the best dog
story ever written, and it inspires regret that dogs
cannot read.</p>

<p>No one who knows Mr. Ollivant's tale can by
any possibility forget the Grey Dog of Kenmuir&mdash;the
perfect, gentle knight&mdash;or the thrilling excitement
of his successful struggles for the cup. He
is indeed a noble and beautiful character, with the
Christian combination of serpent and dove. But
Owd Bob in a slight degree shares the fate of all
beings who approach moral perfection. He reminds
us at times of Tennyson's Arthur in the <i>Idylls of
the King</i>, though he fortunately delivers no lectures.
Lancelot was wicked, and Arthur was good; but
Lancelot has the touch of earth that makes him
interesting, and Arthur has more than a touch of
boredom. In <i>Paradise Lost</i> the spotless Raphael
does not compare in charm with the picturesque
Foe of God and Man. The real hero in Milton, as
I suspect the poet very well knew, is the Devil;
and if Mr. Ollivant had ignored both English and
American godfathers, and called his novel <i>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Tailless Tyke</i>, no reader could have objected.
Red Wull is the Satan of this canine epic; he has
for us a fascination at once horrible and irresistible.
The author seems to have felt that the Grey Dog
was overshadowed; and he has saved our active
sympathy for him by the clever device of making
him at one time dangerously ill, when we realise
how much we love him; and finally by throwing
him under awful suspicion, that we may experience&mdash;as
we certainly do&mdash;the enormous relief of beholding
him guiltless. But in spite of our best
instincts, Red Wull is the protagonist. Dog and
master have never been matched in a more sinister
manner than Adam McAdam and the Tailless Tyke.
Bill Sikes and his companion are nothing to it,
and we cannot help remembering that to the eternal
disgrace of dogs, Bill Sikes's last friend forsook him.
Compared with Red Wull, the Hound of the Baskervilles
is a pet lapdog. When Adam and Wullie
appear upon the scene, we look alive, even as their
virtuous enemies were forced to do, for we know
something is bound to happen. When the little
man is greeted with a concert of hoots and jeers,
we cannot repress some sympathy for him, akin
to our feeling toward the would-be murderer Shylock,
silent and solitary under the noisy taunts
of the feather-headed Gratiano. This bitter and
lonely wretch is a real character, and his strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
personality is presented with extraordinary skill.
There is not a single false touch from first to last;
and the little man with the big dog abides in our
memory. Red Wull is the hero of a hundred fights;
his tremendous and terrible exploits are the very
essence of piratical romance. After he has slain
the two huge beasts of the showman, McAdam
exclaims with a sob of paternal pride, "Ye play so
rough, Wullie!"</p>

<p>And the death of the Tailless Tyke is positively
Homeric. The other dogs, all his ruthless enemies,
whisper to each other and silently steal from the
room. They know that the hour has struck, and
that this will be the last fight. The whole pack
set upon him, each one goaded by the remembrance
of some murdered relative, or by some humiliating
scar. Red Wull asks nothing better than meeting
them all; and the unequal combat becomes a frightful
carnage. At the very end, as much exhausted
by the labour of killing as by his own wounds, the
great dog&mdash;now red indeed&mdash;hears his master's
familiar cry, "Wullie, to me!" and with a super-canine
effort he raises his dying form from the bottom
of the writhing mass, shakes off the surviving
foes, and slowly staggers to McAdam's feet. Like
Samson, the dead which he slew at his death were
more than they which he slew in his life.</p>

<p>Mr. Ollivant's next book, <i>Danny</i>, also a dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
story, was not nearly so effective. The human
characters command the most attention, though
the old man with the weeping eye becomes a bit
wearisome. The passages of pure nature description
are often exquisitely written, and prove that at
heart the author is a poet. But in the narrative
portions there is an unfortunate attempt to conceal
the slightness of the story by preciosity and affectation
in the style. For the simple truth is that in
<i>Danny</i> there is no story worth the telling. We
recall distinctly the lovely young wife and her grim
ironclad of a husband, but just what happened
between the covers of the book escapes us. Although
Mr. Ollivant believes in <i>Danny</i>, in spite of
or because of its lack of popularity, he was so
dissatisfied with the American edition that he
suppressed it. Such an act is an indication of the
high artistic standard that he has set for himself;
ambitious as he is, he would rather merit fame
than have it.</p>

<p>While the readers of <i>Bob</i> and of <i>Danny</i> were
guessing what kind of a dog the young author would
select for his next novel, he surprised us all by
writing an uncaninical work. This story, adorned
with happy illustrations, and printed in big type,
as though for the eyes of children, was called <i>Red-Coat
Captain</i>, and was enigmatically located in
"That Country." Every American publisher to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
whom the manuscript was offered, rejected it, saying
emphatically that it was nonsense; and if there
had not been a strain of idealism in the Head of
the firm that reconsidered and finally printed it,
the book would probably never have felt the press.
Mr. Ollivant was sure that the story would appeal
at first only to a very few, and he requested the
publisher not only to refrain from issuing any advertisement,
but to make the entire first edition
consist of only three copies&mdash;one for the archives of
the House, one for the author, and one for a believing
friend. The children of this world are wiser
in their generation than the children of light; and
the shrewd man of business did not take the petition
very seriously. The verdict Nonsense has been
loudly ratified by many reviewers and readers; to
the few it has been wisdom, to the many foolishness.
For, as was said years ago of a certain
poem, "The capacity to understand such a work
must be spiritual." It matters not how clever one
may be, how well read, how sensitive to artistic
beauties and defects; qualities of a totally different
nature must be present, and even then the time and
place must be right, if one is to seize the inner meaning
of <i>Red-Coat Captain</i>. I was about to say, the
inner meaning of a story <i>like</i> <i>Red-Coat Captain</i>,
but I was stopped by the thought that no story like
it has ever been published, and perhaps never will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
be. Both conception and expression are profoundly
original, and, in spite of some failure of articulation,
the work is strongly marked with genius. It
is an allegory based on the eleventh and twelfth
commandments, which we have good authority for
believing are worth all the ten put together. From
one point of view it is a book for children; the
mysterious setting of the tale is sure to appeal to
certain imaginative boys and girls. But the early
chapters, dealing with the pretty courtship and the
honeymoon, will be fully appreciated only by those
who have some years to their credit or otherwise.
There is in this story the ineffable charm and fragrance
of purity. It is the lily in its author's garden.</p>

<p>Mr. Ollivant's latest novel is the most conventional
of the four, and wholly unlike any of its
predecessors. It is a rattling, riotous romance, placed
in the troublous times of the Napoleonic wars.
The mighty shadow of Nelson falls darkly across
the narrative, but the author has not committed
the sin&mdash;so common in historical romances&mdash;of
making a historical character the chief of the <i>dramatis
personæ</i>. The title rôle is played by <i>The
Gentleman</i>, and he is a hero worthy of Cooper or of
Stevenson. Marked by reckless audacity, brilliant
in swordplay and in horsemanship, clever in turn
of speech, gifted with the manner of a pre-Revolution
Duke&mdash;what more in the heroic line can a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
reader desire? The architecture of the novel and
the staccato paragraphs infallibly remind one of
Victor Hugo, whom, however, Mr. Ollivant does
not know. Nor, outside of the works of Stevenson,
have we ever seen a story minus love so steadily
interesting. It is an amphibious book, and those
who like fighting on land and sea may have their fill.
The percentage of mortality is high; soldiers and
sailors die numerously, and the hideous details of
death are worthy of <i>La Débâcle</i>; there is a welter
of gore. If this were all that could be said, if the
fascination of this romance depended wholly on
the crowded action, it would simply be one more
exciting tale added to the hundreds published every
year; good to read on train and turbine, but not
worth serious attention or criticism. But the incidents,
while frequent and thrilling, are not, at
least to the discriminating reader, the main thing,
as the Germans say. Nor is the construction, clever
enough, nor the characters, real as they are; the
main thing is the style, which, quite different from
that in his former books, is yet all his own. The
style, in the best sense of the word, is pictorial; it
transforms the past into the present. The succession
of events rolls off like a glowing panorama.
It is perhaps natural that many reviewers should
have praised <i>The Gentleman</i> more highly than all
the rest of Mr. Ollivant's work put together; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
notwithstanding its wider appeal, it lacks the permanent
qualities of <i>Bob</i>, and (I believe) of <i>Red-Coat
Captain</i>, for they are original.</p>

<p>That Mr. Ollivant is now on the road to physical
health will be good news. He has already done
work that no one else can do, and we cannot spare
him. His four novels indicate versatility as well
as much greater gifts; and he should be watched
by all who take an interest in contemporary literature
and who believe that the future is as rich as
the past. <i>Bob</i> looks like the best English novel
that has appeared between <i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i>
in 1891, and <i>Joseph Vance</i> in 1906. Nothing
but bodily obstacles can prevent its author from
going far.</p>

<p class="center big">ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</p>


<p>Stevenson spent his life, like an only and lonely
child, in playing games with himself. Most boys
who read romances have the dramatic instinct;
they must forthwith incarnate the memories of their
reading, and anything will do for a <i>mise en scene</i>.
The mudpuddle becomes an ocean, where the pirate
ship is launched; a scrubby apple tree has infinite
possibilities. Armed with a wooden sword, the
child sallies forth in the rain, and fiercely cuts down
the mulleins; could we only see him without being
seen, we should observe the wild light in his eye,
and the frown of battle on his brow. He walks
cautiously in the underbrush, to surprise the ambushed
foe; and it is with rapture that he goes to
sleep in a tent, pitched six yards from the kitchen
door. This spirit of adventure remains in some
men's hearts, even after the hair has grown grey or
gone; they hear the call of the wild, lock up the
desk, go into the woods, and there rejoice in a process
of decivilisation.</p>

<p>In order to enjoy life, one must love it; and nobody
ever loved life more than Stevenson. "It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
better to be a fool than to be dead," said he. To
him the world was always picturesque, whether he
saw it through the mists of Edinburgh, or amid the
snows of Davos, or in the tropical heat of Samoa.
"Where is Samoa?" asked a friend. "Go out of
the Golden Gate," replied Stevenson, "and take
the first turn to the left." This counsel makes up
in joyous imagination what it lacks in latitude and
longitude. Everything in Stevenson's bodily and
mental life was an adventure, to be begun in a spirit
of reckless enthusiasm. In his travels with a donkey,
he was a beloved vagabond, whose wayside acquaintances
are to be envied; in compulsory expeditions
in search of health, he set out with as
much zest as though he were after buried treasure;
everything was an adventure, and his marriage was
the greatest adventure of all. He read books with
the same enthusiasm with which he tramped, or
paddled in a canoe; every new novel he opened
with the spirit of an explorer, for who knows in its
pages what people one may meet? William Archer
sent him a copy of Bernard Shaw's story, <i>Cashel
Byron's Profession</i>, and Stevenson wrote in reply
from Saranac Lake, "Over Bashville the footman
I howled with derision and delight; I dote on
Bashville&mdash;I could read of him for ever; <i>de Bashville
je suis le fervent</i>&mdash;there is only one Bashville,
and I am his devoted slave.... It is all mad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
mad and deliriously delightful.... It is <span class="smcap">Horrid
Fun</span>.... (I say, Archer, my God, what women!)"
What would authors give for a reading public like that?</p>

<p>Prone in bed, when his attention was not diverted
by a hemorrhage, he lived amid the pageantry of
gorgeous day-dreams, presented on the stage of
his brain. We know that Ben Jonson saw the
Romans and Carthaginians fighting, marching
and countermarching, across his great toe. Stevenson
would have understood this perfectly. No pain
or sickness ever daunted him, or held him captive;
his mind was always in some picturesque or immensely
interesting place. In composition, he seemed
to have a double consciousness; he moulded his
sentences with the fastidious care of a great artist;
at the same moment he felt the growing sea-breeze,
and knew that his hero would very soon have to
shorten sail.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to remember that a man who had
such genius for friendship, who so generously admired
the literary work of his contemporaries, and
who loved the whole world of saints and sinners,
received such widespread homage in return. His
career as a man of letters extended over twenty
years; and during the last eight his name was actually
a household word. To be sure, he published
much work of a high order without getting even a
hearing; his <i>Inland Voyage</i>, <i>Travels with a Donkey</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
<i>Virginibus Puerisque</i>, <i>Familiar Studies</i>, <i>New Arabian
Nights</i>, and even <i>Treasure Island</i>, attracted
very little attention; he remained in obscurity.
But when, in the year 1886, appeared the <i>Strange
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>, he found himself
famous; the thrilling excitement of the story, combined
with its powerful moral appeal, simply conquered
the world. And although his own plays were
failures, he had the satisfaction of knowing that
thousands of people in theatres were spellbound
by the modern Morality made out of his novel.
Few writers have become "classics" in so short a
time; during the years that remained to him, he
was compelled to prepare a superb edition of his
<i>Complete Works</i>. Without ever appealing to the
animal nature of humanity, he had the keen satisfaction
of reigning in the hearts of uncultivated
readers, and of receiving the almost universal
tribute of refined critics. There are authors who are
the delight of a bookish few, and there are authors
with an enormous public and no reputation. There
are poets like Donne, and prose-masters like Browne,
precious to the men and women of patrician taste; and
there are some familiar examples of the other kind,
needless to call by name. Stevenson pleases us all;
for he always has a good story, and the subtlety of
his art gives to his narrative imperishable beauty.</p>

<p>Stevenson's appearance as a novelist was in itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
an adventure. He seemed at first as obsolete as
a soldier of fortune. He was as unexpected and
as picturesque among contemporary writers of fiction
as an Elizabethan knight in a modern drawing-room.
When he placed <i>Treasure Island</i> on the
literary map, Realism was at its height in some
localities, and at its depth in others. But it was
everywhere the standard form, in which young
writers strove to embody their visions. Zola had
just made an address in which he remarked that
Walter Scott was dead, and that the fashion of his
style had passed away. The experimental novel
would go hand in hand with the advance of scientific
thought. And there were many who believed that
Zola spoke the truth. This state of affairs was a
tremendous challenge to Stevenson, and he accepted
it in the spirit of chivalry. The very name of his
first novel, <i>Treasure Island</i>, was like the flying of
a flag. Those critics who saw it must have smiled,
and shaken their wise heads, for had not the time
for such follies gone by? Stevenson was fully aware
of what he was doing; in the midst of contemporary
fiction he felt as impatient and as ill at ease as a
boy, imprisoned in a circle of elders, whose conversation
does not in the least interest him. His
sentiments are clearly shown in a letter to the late
Mr. Henley, written shortly after the appearance of
<i>Treasure Island</i>, and which is important enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
quote somewhat fully:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I do desire a book of adventure&mdash;a romance&mdash;and no
man will get or write me one. Dumas I have read and reread

book, I guess, like <i>Treasure Island</i>, alas! which I have never
read, and cannot though I live to ninety. I would God that
someone else had written it! By all that I can learn, it is
the very book for my complaint. I like the way I hear it
opens; and they tell me John Silver is good fun. And to
me it is, and must ever be, a dream unrealised, a book unwritten.

<p>The time was out of joint; but Stevenson was born
to set it right. Not seven years after the posting
of this letter, the recent Romantic Revival had
begun. In the year of his death, 1894, it was in
full swing; everybody was reading not only Stevenson,
but <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i>, <i>A Gentleman of
France</i>, <i>Under the Red Robe</i>, etc. Whatever we
may think of the literary quality of some of these
then popular stories, there is no doubt that the change
was in many ways beneficial, and that the influence
of Stevenson was more responsible for it than that
of any other one man. This was everywhere recognised:
in the <i>Athenæum</i> for 22 December, 1894,
a critic remarked, "The Romantic Revival in the
English novel of to-day had in him its leader....
But for him they might have been Howells and
James young men." As a germinal writer, Stevenson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
will always occupy an important place in the
history of English prose fiction. And seldom has
a man been more conscious of his mission.</p>

<p>Stevenson's high standing as an English classic
depends very largely on the excellence of his literary
style, although Scott and Cooper won immortality
without it. (One wonders if they could to-day.)
When some fifteen years ago a few critics had the
temerity to suggest that he was equal, if not superior,
to these worthies, it sounded like blasphemy; but
such an opinion is not uncommon now, and may be
reasonably defended. Stevenson lacked in some
degree the virility and the astonishing fertility of
invention possessed by Scott; but he exhibited a
technical skill undreamed of by his great predecessor.
From the prefatory verses to <i>Treasure Island</i>, we
know that he admired Cooper; and he loved Sir
Walter, without being in the least blind to his faults.
"It is undeniable that the love of the slap-dash and
the shoddy grew upon Scott with success." He
"had not only splendid romantic, but splendid tragic,
gifts. How comes it, then, that he could so often
fob us off with languid, inarticulate twaddle?...
He was a great day-dreamer, a seer of fit and beautiful
and humorous visions, but hardly a great artist;
hardly, in the manful sense, an artist at all." Stevenson
seems to have felt that Scott's deficiencies
in style were not merely artistic, but moral; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
lacked the patience and the particular kind of industry
required. Scott loved to tell a good story,
but he loved the story better than he did the telling
of it; Stevenson, on the other hand, was fully as
much absorbed by the manner of narration as by
the narration itself. Stevenson was keenly alive
to the fact that writers of romances did not seem to
feel the necessity of style; whereas those who wrote
novels wherein nothing happened, felt that a good
style atoned for both the lack of incident and the
lack of ideas. Stevenson's articles of literary faith
apparently included the dogma that a mysterious,
blood-curdling romance had fully as much dignity
as a minute examination of the dreary, commonplace
life of the submerged; and that the former
made just as high a demand on the endowment and
industry of a master-artist. If he had had not an
idea in his head, he could not have written with more
elegance.</p>

<p>There is, of course, some truth in the charge that
Stevenson was not only a master of style, but a
stylist. He is indeed something of a macaroni in
words; occasionally he struts a bit, and he loves
to show his brilliant plumes. He performed dexterous
tricks with language, like a musician with a
difficult instrument. He liked style for its own
sake, and was not averse to exhibiting his technique.
In a slight degree, his attitude and his influence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
mere composition are somewhat similar to those of
John Lyly three hundred years before. Lyly delighted
his readers with unexpected quips and quiddities,
with a fantastic display of rhetoric; he
showed, as no one had before him, the possible
flexibility of English prose. There is more than a
touch of Euphuism in Stevenson; he was never
insincere, but he was consciously fine. Many have
swallowed without salt his statement that he learned
to write by imitation; that by the "sedulous ape"
method, employed with unwearying study of great
models, he himself became a successful author.
Men of genius are never to be trusted when they
discuss the origin and development of their powers;
it is no more to be believed that Stevenson learned
to be a great writer by imitating Browne, than that
<i>The Raven</i> really reached its perfection in the manner
so minutely described by Poe. The faithful
practice of composition will doubtless help any
ambitious young man or woman. But Stevensons
are not made in that fashion. If they were, anyone
with plenty of time and patience could become a
great author. This "ape" remark by Stevenson
has had one interesting effect; if he imitated others,
he has been strenuously imitated himself. Probably
no recent English writer has been more constantly
employed for rhetorical purposes, and there is none
whose influence on style is more evident in the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of contemporary aspirants in fiction.</p>

<p>The stories of Stevenson exhibit a double union,
as admirable as it is rare. They exhibit the union
of splendid material with the most delicate skill
in language; and they exhibit the union of thrilling
events with a remarkable power of psychological
analysis. Every thoughtful reader has noticed
these combinations; but we sometimes forget that
Silver, Alan, Henry, and the Master are just as fine
examples of character-portrayal as can be found in
the works of Henry James. It is from this point
of view that Stevenson is so vastly superior to Fenimore
Cooper; just as in literary style he so far surpasses
Scott. <i>Treasure Island</i> is much better than
<i>The Red Rover</i> or <i>The Pirate</i>; its author actually
beat Scott and Cooper at their own game. With
the exception of <i>Henry Esmond</i>, Stevenson may
perhaps be said to have written the best romances
in the English language; the undoubted inferiority
of any of his books to that masterpiece would make
an interesting subject for reflexion.</p>

<p>The one thing in which Scott really excelled
Stevenson was in the depiction of women. The
latter has given us no Diana Vernon or Jeannie
Deans. For the most part, Stevenson's romances
are Paradise before the creation of Eve. The snake
is there, but not the woman. This extraordinary
absence of sex-interest is a notable feature, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
have been the reasons assigned for it. If he had not
tried at all, we should be safe in saying that, like
a small boy, he felt that girls were in the way, and
he did not want them mussing up his games. There
is perhaps some truth in this; for the presence of
a girl might have ruined <i>Treasure Island</i>, as it
ruined the <i>Sea Wolf</i>. Her fuss and feathers bring
in all sorts of bothersome problems to distract a
novelist, bent on having a good time with pirates,
murders, and hidden treasure. Unfortunately for
the complete satisfaction of this explanation, Stevenson
wrote <i>Prince Otto</i>, and tried to draw a real woman.
The result did not add anything to his fame, and,
indeed, the whole book missed fire. He was unquestionably
more successful in <i>David Balfour</i>, but,
when all is said, the presence of women in a few of
Stevenson's romances is not so impressive as their
absence in most. It is only in that unfinished work,
<i>Weir of Hermiston</i>, which gave every promise of
being one of the greatest novels in English literature,
that he seemed to have reached full maturity of
power in dealing with the master passion. The best
reason for Stevenson's reserve on matters of sex was
probably his delicacy; he did not wish to represent
this particular animal impulse with the same vivid
reality he pictured avarice, ambition, courage,
cowardice, and pride; and thus hampered by conscience,
he thought it best in the main to omit it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
altogether. At least, this is the way he felt about it,
as we may learn from the <i>Vailima Letters</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"This is a poison bad world for the romancer, this Anglo-Saxon
world; I usually get out of it by not having any women
in it at all." (February, 1892.)</p>

<p>"I am afraid my touch is a little broad in a love story;
I can't mean one thing and write another. As for women,
I am no more in any fear of them; I can do a sort all right;
age makes me less afraid of a petticoat, but I am a little in
fear of grossness. However, this David Balfour's love affair,
that's all right&mdash;might be read out to a mothers' meeting&mdash;or
a daughters' meeting. The difficulty in a love yarn, which
dwells at all on love, is the dwelling on one string; it is manifold,
I grant, but the root fact is there unchanged, and the
sentiment being very intense, and already very much handled
in letters, positively calls for a little pawing and gracing.
With a writer of my prosaic literalness and pertinency of point
of view, this all shoves toward grossness&mdash;positively even
towards the far more damnable <i>closeness</i>. This has kept
me off the sentiment hitherto, and now I am to try: Lord!
Of course Meredith can do it, and so could Shakespeare;
but with all my romance, I am a realist and a prosaist, and
a most fanatical lover of plain physical sensations plainly
and expressly rendered; hence my perils. To do love in
the same spirit as I did (for instance) D. Balfour's fatigue in
the heather; my dear sir, there were grossness&mdash;ready
made! And hence, how to sugar?" (May, 1892.)</p></blockquote>

<p>On the whole, I am inclined to think, that with
the omission of the fragment, <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>,
Stevenson's best novel is his first&mdash;<i>Treasure Island</i>.
He wrote this with peculiar zest; first of all, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of the playful dedication, to please himself; second,
to see if the public appetite for Romance could once
more be stimulated. He never did anything later
quite so off-hand, quite so spontaneous. His maturer
books, brilliant as they are, lack the peculiar <i>brightness</i>
of <i>Treasure Island</i>. It has more unity than
<i>The Master of Ballantræ</i>; and it has a greater group
of characters than <i>Kidnapped</i>.</p>

<p>Stevenson told this story in the first person, but,
by a clever device, he avoided the chief difficulty of
that method of narration. The speaker is not one
of the principal characters in the story, though he
shares in the most thrilling adventures. We thus
have all the advantages of direct discourse, all the
gain in reality&mdash;without a hint as to what will be
the fate of the leading actors. Stevenson said, in
one of the <i>Vailima Letters</i>, that first-person tales were
more in accord with his temperament. The purely
objective character of this novel is noteworthy, and
entirely proper, coming from a perfectly normal boy.
The <i>Essays</i> show that Stevenson could be sufficiently
introspective if he chose, and <i>Dr. Jekyll</i> is really an
introspective novel, differing in every way from
<i>Treasure Island</i>. But here we have romantic adventures
seen through the fresh eyes of boyhood,
producing their unconscious reflex action on the
soul of the narrator, who daily grows in courage and
self-reliance by grappling with danger. In Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
James's fine and penetrating essay on Stevenson,
he says of this book, "What we see in it is not only
the ideal fable, but the young reader himself and his
state of mind: we seem to read it over his shoulder,
with an arm around his neck." This particular
remark has been much praised; but it seems in a
way to half-apologise for a man's interest in the
story, and to explain it like an affectionate uncle's
sympathetic interest in a child's game, who mainly
enjoys the child's enthusiasm. Now I venture to
say that no one can any more outgrow <i>Treasure
Island</i> than he can outgrow <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. The
events in the story delight children; but it is a book
that in mature years can be read and reread with
ever increasing satisfaction and profit. No one needs
to regret or to explain his interest in this novel; it
is nothing to be sorry for, nor does it indicate a low
order of literary taste. Many serious persons have
felt somewhat alarmed by their pleasure in reading
<i>Treasure Island</i>, and have hesitated to assign it a
high place in fiction. Some have said that, after
all, it is only a pirate story, differing from the Sleuths
and Harkaways merely in being better written.
But this is exactly the point, and a very important
point, in criticism. In art, the subject is of comparatively
little importance, whereas the treatment
is the absolute distinguishing feature. To insist
that there is little difference between <i>Treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Island</i> and any cheap tale of blood-and-thunder, is
equivalent to saying that there is little difference
between the Sistine Madonna and a cottage chromo
of the Virgin.</p>

<p>Pew is a fearsome personage, and a notable example
of the triumph of mind over the most serious
of all physical disabilities. Theoretically, it seems
strange that able-bodied individuals should be afraid
of a man who is stone blind. But the appearance
of Pew is enough to make anybody take to his heels.
He is the very essence of authority and leadership.
The tap-tapping of his stick in the moonlight makes
one's blood run cold. We are apt to think of blind
people as gentle, sweet, pure, and holy; made submissive
and tender by misfortune, dependent on
the kindness of others. Old Pew has lost his eyes,
but not his nerve. To see so black-hearted and
unscrupulous a villain, his sight taken away as it
were by the hand of God, and yet intent only on
desperate wickedness, upsets the moral order; he
becomes an uncanny monstrosity; he takes on the
hue of a supernatural fiend. John Silver has lost
a leg, but he circumvents others by the speed of
his mind; amazingly quick in perception, a most
astute politician, arrested from no treachery or murder
by any moral principle or touch of pity, he has
the dark splendour of unflinching depravity. He
is no Laodicean. He never lets I dare not wait upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
I would. His course seems fickle and changeable,
but he is really steering steadily by the compass of
self-interest. He can be witty, affectionate, sympathetic,
friendly, submissive, flattering, and also a
devilish beast. He is the very chameleon of crime.
Stevenson simply had not the heart to kill so consummate
an artist in villainy. It was no mean
achievement to create two heroes so sinister as Pew
and Silver, while depriving one of his sight and the
other of a leg. One wearies of the common run of
romances, where the chief character is a man of
colossal size and beautifully proportioned, so that
his victories over various rascals are really only
athletic records. In <i>Treasure Island</i>, the emphasis
is laid in the right place, whence leadership comes;
everybody is afraid of Long John, and nobody
minds Ben Gunn, dead or alive.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>There are scenes in this story, presented with
such dramatic power, and with such astonishing
felicity of diction, that, once read, they can never
pass from the reader's mind. The expression in
Silver's face, as he talks with Tom in the marsh,
first ingratiatingly friendly, then suspicious, then
as implacable as malignant fate. The hurling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the crutch; the two terrific stabs of the knife. "I
could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows."
The boy's struggle on the schooner with Israel
Hands; the awful moment in the little boat, while
Flint's gunner is training the "long nine" on her,
and the passengers can do nothing but await the
result of the enemy's skill; the death of the faithful
old servant, Redruth, who said he thought somebody
might read a prayer.</p>

<p>Much has been written in both prose and verse
of the fascination of Stevenson's personality. He was
so different in different moods that no two of his
friends have ever agreed as to what manner of man he
really was. As he chose to express his genius mainly
in objective romances, future generations will find
in the majority of his works no hint as to the character
of the author. From this point of view, compare
for a moment <i>The Master of Ballantræ</i> with
<i>Joseph Vance</i>! But fortunately, Stevenson elected
to write personal essays; and still more fortunately,
hundreds of his most intimate letters are preserved
in type. Some think that these <i>Letters</i> form his
greatest literary work, and that they will outlast
his novels, plays, poems, and essays. For they will
have a profound interest long after the last person
who saw Stevenson on earth has passed away.
They are the revelation of a man even more interesting
than any of the wonderful characters he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
created; they show that men like Philip Sidney
were as possible in the nineteenth century as in the
brilliant age of Elizabeth. The life of Stevenson has
added immensely to our happiness and enjoyment
of the world, and no literary figure in recent times
had more radiance and wholesome charm. His
optimism was based on a chronic experience of
physical pain and weakness; to him it was a good
world, and he made it distinctly better by his presence.
He was a combination of the Bohemian
and the Covenanter; he had all the graces of one,
and the bed-rock moral earnestness of the other.
"The world must return some day to the word
'duty,'" said he, "and be done with the word 'reward.'"
He was the incarnation of the happy
union of virtue and vivacity.</p>

<p class="center big">MRS. HUMPHRY WARD</p>


<p>It is high time that somebody spoke out his mind
about Mrs. Humphry Ward. Her prodigious vogue
is one of the most extraordinary literary phenomena
of our day. A roar of approval greets the publication
of every new novel from her active pen, and it
is almost pathetic to contemplate the reverent awe
of her army of worshippers when they behold the
solemn announcement that she is "collecting material"
for another masterpiece. Even professional
reviewers lose all sense of proportion when they
discuss her books, and their so-called criticisms
sound like publishers' advertisements. Sceptics
are warned to remain silent, lest they become unpleasantly
conspicuous. When <i>Lady Rose's Daughter</i>
appeared, the critic of a great metropolitan daily
remarked that whoever did not immediately recognise
the work as a masterpiece thereby proclaimed himself
as a person incapable of judgement, taste, and
appreciation. This is a fair example of the attitude
taken by thousands of her readers, and it is this
attitude, rather than the value of her work, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
must, first of all, consider.</p>

<p>In the year 1905 an entirely respectable journal
said of Mrs. Ward, "There is no more interesting
and important figure in the literary world to-day."
In comparing this superlative with the actual state
of affairs, we find that we were asked to believe that
Mrs. Ward was a literary personage not second in
importance to Tolstoi, Ibsen, Björnson, Heyse,
Sudermann, Hauptmann, Anatole France, Jules
Lemaître, Rostand, Swinburne, Thomas Hardy,
Meredith, Kipling, and Mark Twain. At about
the same time a work appeared intended as a text-book
for the young, which declared Mrs. Ward to
be "the greatest living writer of fiction in English
literature," and misspelled her name&mdash;an excellent
illustration of carelessness in adjectives with inaccuracy
in facts. Over and over again we have
heard the statement that the "mantle" of George
Eliot has fallen on Mrs. Ward. Is it really true
that her stories are equal in value to <i>Adam Bede</i>,
<i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, and <i>Middlemarch</i>?</p>

<p>The object of this essay is not primarily to attack
a dignified and successful author; it is rather to
enquire, in a proper spirit of humility, and with a
full realisation of the danger incurred, whether or
not the actual output justifies so enormous a reputation.
For in some respects I believe the vogue
of Mrs. Ward to be more unfortunate than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
vogue of the late lamented Duchess, of Laura Jean
Libbey, of Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth, of Marie
Corelli, and of Hall Caine. When we are asked to
note that 300,000 copies of the latest novel by any
of these have been sold before the book is published,
there is no cause for alarm. We know perfectly
well what that means. It is what is called a "business
proposition"; it has nothing to do with literature.
It simply proves that it is possible to make
as splendid a fortune out of the trade of book-making,
and by equally respectable methods, as is made
in other legitimate avenues of business. But the
case is quite different with Mrs. Ward. Whatever
she is, she is not vulgar, sensational, or cheap;
she has never made the least compromise with her
moral ideals, nor has she ever attempted to play
to the gallery. Her constituency is made up largely
of serious-minded, highly respectable people, who
live in good homes, who are fairly well read, and
who ought to know the difference between ordinary
and extraordinary literature. Her books have had
a bad effect in blurring this distinction in the popular
mind; for while she has never written a positively
bad book,&mdash;with the possible exception of <i>Bessie
Costrell</i>,&mdash;I feel confident that she has never
written supremely well; that, compared with the
great masters of fiction, she becomes immediately
insignificant. If there ever was a successful writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
whose work shows industry and talent rather than
genius, that writer is Mrs. Ward. If there ever
was a successful writer whose work is ordinary
rather than extraordinary, it is Mrs. Ward.</p>

<p>To those of us who delight in getting some enjoyment
even out of the most depressing facts, the growth
of Mrs. Ward's reputation has its humorous aspect.
The same individuals (mostly feminine) who in
1888 read <i>Robert Elsmere</i> with dismay, who thought
the sale of the work should be prohibited, and the
copies already purchased removed from circulating
libraries, are the very same ones who now worship
what they once denounced. She was then regarded
as a destroyer of Christian faith. Well, if she was
Satan then, she is Satan still (one Western clergyman,
in advocating at that time the suppression of
the work, said he believed in hitting the devil right
between the eyes). She has given no sign of recantation,
or even of penitence. I remember one
fond mother, who, fearful of the effect of the book
on her daughter's growing mind, marked all the
worst passages, and then told Alice she might read
it, provided she skipped all the blazed places! That
indicated not only a fine literary sense, but a remarkable
knowledge of human nature. I wonder what
the poor girl did when she came to the danger signals!
And, as a matter of fact, how valuable or vital would
a Christian faith be that could be destroyed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
perusal of <i>Robert Elsmere</i>? It is almost difficult
now to bring to distinct recollection the tremendous
excitement caused by Mrs. Ward's first successful
novel, for it is a long time since I heard its name
mentioned. The last public notice of it that I can
recall was a large sign which appeared some fifteen
years ago in a New Haven apothecary's window to
the effect that one copy of <i>Robert Elsmere</i> would be
presented free to each purchaser of a cake of soap!</p>

<p>Although <i>Robert Elsmere</i> was an immediate and
prodigious success, and made it certain that whatever
its author chose to write next would be eagerly
bought, it is wholly untrue to say that her subsequent
novels have depended in any way on <i>Elsmere</i>
for their reputation. There are many instances
in professional literary careers where one immensely
successful book&mdash;<i>Lorna Doone</i>, for example&mdash;has
floated a long succession of works that could not
of themselves stay above water; many an author has
succeeded in attaching a life-preserver to literary
children who cannot swim. Far otherwise is the
case with Mrs. Ward. It is probable that over
half the readers of <i>Diana Mallory</i> have never
seen a copy of <i>Robert Elsmere</i>, for which, incidentally,
they are to be congratulated. But many of us can
easily recollect with what intense eagerness the
novel that followed that sensation was awaited.
Every one wondered if it would be equally good;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and many confidently predicted that she had shot
her bolt. As a matter of fact, not only was <i>David
Grieve</i> a better novel than <i>Robert Elsmere</i>, but, in
my judgement, it is the best book its author has ever
written. Oscar Wilde said that <i>Robert Elsmere</i>
was <i>Literature and Dogma</i> with the literature left
out. Now, <i>David Grieve</i> has no dogma at all, but
in a certain sense it does belong to literature. It
has some actual dynamic quality. The character of
David, and its development in a strange environment,
are well analysed; and altogether the best thing in
the work, taken as a whole, is the perspective. It
is a difficult thing to follow a character from childhood
up, within the pages of one volume, and have
anything like the proper perspective. It requires
for one thing, hard, painstaking industry; but Mrs.
Ward has never been afraid of work. She cannot
be accused of laziness or carelessness. The ending
of this book is, of course, weak, like the conclusion
of all her books, for she has never learned the fine
art of saying farewell, either to her characters or to
the reader.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1894&mdash;a year made memorable
by the appearance of <i>Trilby</i>, the <i>Prisoner of Zenda</i>,
<i>The Jungle Book</i>, <i>Lord Ormont and his Aminta</i>,
<i>Esther Waters</i>, and other notable novels&mdash;that Mrs.
Ward greatly increased her reputation and widened
her circle of readers by the publication of <i>Marcella</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Here she gave us a political-didactic-realistic novel,
which she has continued to publish steadily ever
since under different titles. It was gravely announced
that this new book would deal with socialism and
the labour question. Many readers, who felt that
she had said the last word on agnosticism in <i>Elsmere</i>,
now looked forward with reverent anticipation not
only to the final solution of socialistic problems, but
to some coherent arrangement of their own vague
and confused ideas. Naturally, they got just what
they deserved&mdash;a voluminous statement of various
aspects of the problem, with no solution at all. It
is curious how many persons suppose that their
favourite author or orator has done something toward
settling questions, when, as a matter of fact,
all he has done is to <i>state</i> them, and then state them
again. This is especially true of philosophical
and metaphysical difficulties. Think how eagerly
readers took up Professor James's exceedingly clever
book on Pragmatism, hoping at last to find rest in
some definite principle. And if there ever was a
blind alley in philosophy, it is Pragmatism&mdash;the
very essence of agnosticism.</p>

<p>Now, <i>Marcella</i>, as a document, is both radical
and reactionary. There is an immense amount of
radical talk; but the heroine's schemes fail, the
Labour party is torn by dissension, Wharton proves
to be a scoundrel, and the rebel Marcella marries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a respectable nobleman. There is not a single page
in the book, with all its wilderness of words, that
can be said to be in any sense a serious contribution
to the greatest of all purely political problems.
And, as a work of art, it is painfully limited; but
since it has the same virtues and defects of all her
subsequent literary output, we may consider what
these virtues and defects are.</p>

<p>In the first place, Mrs. Ward is totally lacking in
one almost fundamental quality of the great novelist&mdash;a
keen sense of humour. Who are the English
novelists of the first class? They are Defoe, Richardson,
Fielding, Scott, Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackeray,
George Eliot, Stevenson, and perhaps Hardy.
Every one of these shows humour enough and to
spare, with the single exception of Richardson, and
he atoned for the deficiency by a terrible intensity
that has seldom, if ever, been equalled in English
fiction. Now, the absence of humour in a book
is not only a positive loss to the reader, in that it
robs him of the fun which is an essential part of the
true history of any human life, and thereby makes
the history to that extent inaccurate and unreal,
but the writer who has no humour seldom gets the
right point of view. There is infinitely more in the
temperament of the humorist than mere laughter.
Just as the poet sees life through the medium of
a splendid imagination, so the humorist has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
almost infallible guide of sympathy. The humorist
sees life in a large, tolerant, kindly way; he knows
that life is a tragi-comedy, and he makes the reader
feel it in that fashion.</p>

<p>Again, the lack of humour in a writer destroys
the sense of proportion. The humorist sees the
salient points&mdash;the merely serious writer gives us a
mass of details. In looking back over the thousands
of pages of fiction that Mrs. Ward has published,
how few great scenes stand out bright in the memory!
The principle of selection&mdash;so important a part
of all true art&mdash;is conspicuous only by its absence.
This is one reason for the sameness of her books.
All that we can remember is an immense number
of social functions and an immense amount of political
gossip&mdash;a long, sad level of mediocrity. This
perhaps helps to explain why German fiction is so
markedly inferior to the French. The German,
in his scientific endeavour to get in the whole of life,
gives us a mass of unrelated detail. A French
writer by a few phrases makes us see a character
more clearly than a German presents him after
many painful pages of wearisome description.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward is not too much in earnest in following
her ideals of art; no one can be. But she is too
sadly serious. There is a mental tension in her
books, like the tension of overwork and mental
exhaustion, like the tension of overwrought nerves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
her books are, in fact, filled with tired and overworked
men and women, jaded and gone stale.
How many of her characters seem to need a change&mdash;what
they want is rest and sleep! Many of them
ought to be in a sanatorium.</p>

<p>Her books are devoid of charm. One does not
have to compare her with the great masters to feel
this deficiency; it would not be fair to compare
her with Thackeray. But if we select among all the
novelists of real distinction the one whom, perhaps,
she most closely approaches,&mdash;Anthony Trollope,&mdash;the
enormous distance between <i>Diana Mallory</i>
and <i>Framley Parsonage</i> is instantly manifest. We
think of Trollope with a glow of reminiscent delight;
but although Trollope and Mrs. Ward talk endlessly
on much the same range of subject-matter, how
far apart they really are! Mrs. Ward's books are
crammed with politicians and clergymen, who keep
the patient reader informed on modern aspects of
political and religious thought; but the difficulty
is that they substitute phrases for ideas. Mrs.
Ward knows all the political and religious cant of
the day; she is familiar with the catch-words that
divide men into hostile camps; but in all these dreary
pages of serious conversation there is no real illumination.
She completely lacks the art that Trollope
possessed, of making ordinary people attractive.
But to find out the real distance that separates her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
productions from literature, one should read, let us
say, <i>The Marriage of William Ashe</i> and then take
up <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. The novels of Mrs. Ward
bear about the same relation to first-class fiction
that maps and atlases bear to great paintings.</p>

<p>This lack of charm that I always feel in reading
Mrs. Ward's books (and I have read them all) is
owing not merely to the lack of humour. It is
partly due to what seems to be an almost total
absence of freshness, spontaneity, and originality.
Mrs. Ward works like a well-trained and high-class
graduate student, who is engaged in the preparation
of a doctor's thesis. Her discussions of socialism,
her scenes in the House of Commons and on the
Terrace, her excursions to Italy, her references
to political history, her remarks on the army, her
disquisitions on theology, her pictures of campaign
riots, her studies of defective drainage, her representations
of the labouring classes,&mdash;all these are
"worked up" in a scholarly and scientific manner;
there is the modern passion for accuracy, there is the
German completeness of detail,&mdash;there is, in fact,
everything except the breath of life. She works
in the descriptive manner, from the outside in&mdash;not
in the inspired manner which goes with imagination,
sympathy, and genius. She is not only a
student, she is a journalist; she is a special correspondent
on politics and theology; but she is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
a creative writer. For she has the critical, not the
creative, temperament.</p>

<p>The monotonous sameness of her books, which
has been mentioned above, is largely owing to the
sameness of her characters. She changes the frames,
but not the portraits. First of all, in almost any of
her books we are sure to meet the studious, intellectual
young man. He always has a special library
on some particular subject, with the books all annotated.
One wearies of this perpetual character's
perpetual library, crowded, as it always is, with
the latest French and German monographs. Her
heroes smell of books and dusty dissertations, and
the conversations of these heroes are plentifully
lacking in native wit and originality&mdash;they are the
mere echoes of their reading. Let us pass in review
a few of these serious students&mdash;Robert Elsmere,
Langham, Aldous Reyburn (who changes into Lord
Maxwell, but who remains a prig), the melancholy
Helbeck, the insufferable Manisty, Jacob Delafield,
William Ashe, Oliver Marsham&mdash;all, all essentially
the same, tiresome, dull, heavy men&mdash;what a
pity they were not intended as satires! Second, as
a foil to this man, we have the Byronic, clever, romantic,
sentimental, insincere man&mdash;who always
degenerates or dies in a manner that exalts the dull
and superior virtues of his antagonist. Such a
man is Wharton, or Sir George Tressady, or Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Warkworth, or Cliffe&mdash;they have different names
in different novels, but they are the same character.
Curiously enough, the only convincing men that
appear in her pages are <i>old</i> men&mdash;men like Lord
Maxwell or Sir James Chide. In portraying this
type she achieves success.</p>

<p>What shall we say of her heroines? They have the
same suspicious resemblance so characteristic of
her heroes; they are represented as physically beautiful,
intensely eager for morality and justice, with an
extraordinary fund of information, and an almost
insane desire to impart it. Her heroine is likely to
be or to become a power in politics; even at a tender
age she rules society by the brilliancy of her conversation;
in a crowded drawing-room the Prime Minister
hangs upon her words; diplomats are amazed at
her intimate knowledge of foreign relations, and of
the resources of the British Empire; and she can
entertain a whole ring of statesmen and publicists
by giving to each exactly the right word at the right
moment. Men who are making history come to
her not only for inspiration but for guidance, for
she can discourse fluently on all phases of the troublesome
labour question. And yet, if we may judge
of this marvellous creature not by the attitude of
the other characters in the book, but by the actual
words that fall from her lips, we are reminded of
the woman whom Herbert Spencer's friends selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
as his potential spouse. They shut him up with
her, and awaited the result with eagerness, for they
told him she had a great mind; but on emerging
from the trial interview Spencer remarked that
she would not do at all: "The young lady is, in
my opinion, too highly intellectual; or, I should
rather say&mdash;morbidly intellectual. A small brain
in a state of intense activity." Was there ever a
better formula for Mrs. Ward's constantly recurring
heroine? Now, as a foil to Marcella, Diana Mallory,
and the others, Mrs. Ward gives us the frivolous,
mischief-making, would-be brilliant, and actually
vulgar woman, who makes much trouble for the
heroine and ultimately more for herself&mdash;the wife
of Sir George Tressady, the young upstart in <i>Diana
Mallory</i>, and all the rest of them. By the introduction
of these characters there is an attempt to lend
colour to the dull pages of the novels. These
women are at heart adventuresses, but they are apt
to lack the courage of their convictions; instead of
being brilliant and terrible,&mdash;like the great adventuresses
of fiction,&mdash;they are as dull in sin as
their antagonists are dull in virtue. Mrs. Ward
cannot make them real; compare any one of them
with Thackeray's Beatrix or with Becky Sharp&mdash;to
say nothing of the long list of sinister women in
French and Russian fiction.</p>

<p>There are no "supreme moments" in Mrs. Ward's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
books; no great dramatic situations; she has tried
hard to manage this, for she has had repeatedly
one eye on the stage. When <i>The Marriage of
William Ashe</i> and <i>Lady Rose's Daughter</i> appeared,
one could almost feel the strain for dramatic effect.
It was as though she had realised that her previous
books were treatises rather than novels, and had
gathered all her energies together to make a severe
effort for real drama. But, unfortunately, the
scholarly and critical temperament is not primarily
adapted for dramatic masterpieces. In the endeavour
to recall thrilling scenes in her novels, scenes
that brand themselves for ever on the memory, one
has only to compare her works with such stories
as <i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i> or <i>The Return of
the Native</i>, and her painful deficiency is immediately
apparent.</p>

<p>In view of what I believe to be the standard
mediocrity of her novels, how shall we account for
their enormous vogue? The fact is, whether we
like it or not, that she is one of the most widely read
of all living novelists. Well, in the first place, she
is absolutely respectable and safe. It is assuredly
to her credit that she has never stooped for popularity.
She has never descended to melodrama, clap-trap,
or indecency. She is never spectacular and declamatory
like Marie Corelli, and she is never morally
offensive like some popular writers who might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
mentioned. She writes for a certain class of readers
whom she thoroughly understands: they are the
readers who abhor both vulgarity and pruriency,
and who like to enter vicariously, as they certainly
do in her novels, into the best English society. In
her social functions her readers can have the pleasure
of meeting prime ministers, lords, and all the dwellers
in Mayfair, and they know that nothing will be said
that is shocking or improper. Her books can safely
be recommended to young people, and they reflect
the current movement of English thought as well as
could be done by a standard English review. She
has a well-furnished and highly developed intellect;
she is deeply read; she makes her readers think
that they are thinking. She tries to make up for
artistic deficiencies by an immense amount of information.
Fifty years ago it is probable that she
would not have written novels at all, but rather
thoughtful and intellectual critical essays, for which
her mind is admirably fitted. She unconsciously
chose the novel simply because the novel has been,
during the last thirty years, the chief channel of
literary expression. But in spite of her popularity,
it should never be forgotten that the novel is an art-form,
not a medium for doctrinaires.</p>

<p>Then, with her sure hand on the pulse of the public,
she is always intensely modern, intensely contemporary;
again like a well-trained journalist. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
knows exactly what Society is talking about, for she
emphatically belongs to it. This is once more a
reason why so many people believe that she holds
the key to great problems of social life, and that her
next book will give the solution. Many hoped that
her novel on America, carefully worked up during
her visit here, would give the final word on American
social life. Both England and the United States
were to find out what the word "American" really
means.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward is an exceedingly talented, scholarly,
and thoughtful woman, of lofty aims and actuated
only by noble motives; she is hungry for intellectual
food, reading both old texts and the daily papers with
avidity. She has a highly trained, sensitive, critical
mind,&mdash;but she is destitute of the divine spark of
genius. Her books are the books of to-day, not of
to-morrow; for while the political and religious
questions of to-day are of temporary interest, the
themes of the world's great novels are what Richardson
called "love and nonsense, men and women"&mdash;and
these are eternal.</p>

<p class="center big">RUDYARD KIPLING</p>


<p>Mr. Rudyard Kipling is in the anomalous and
fortunate position of having enjoyed a prodigious
reputation for twenty years, and being still a young
man. Few writers in the world to-day are better
known than he; and it is to be hoped and expected
that he has before him over thirty years of active
production. He has not yet attained the age of
forty-five; but his numerous stories, novels, and
poems have reached the unquestioned dignity of
"works," and in uniform binding they make on my
library shelves a formidable and gallant display.
Foreigners read them in their own tongues; critical
essays in various languages are steadily accumulating;
and he has received the honour of being himself the
hero of a strange French novel.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> His popularity
with the general mass of readers has been sufficient
to satisfy the wildest dreams of an author's ambition;
and his fame is, in a way, officially sanctioned by the
receipt of honorary degrees from McGill University,
from Durham, from Oxford, and from Cambridge;
and in 1907 he was given the Nobel Prize, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
ratifying applause of the whole world. There is
no indication that either the shouts of the mob or
the hoods of Doctorates have turned his head; he
remains to-day what he always has been&mdash;a hard,
conscientious workman, trying to do his best every
time.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Kipling is British to the core, there
is nothing insular about his experience; he is as
much-travelled as Ulysses.</p>

<span class="i2q">"For always roaming with a hungry heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Much have I seen and known: cities of men,<br /></span>

<p>Born in India, educated at an English school, circumnavigator
of the globe, he is equally at home
in the snows of the Canadian Rockies, or in the
fierce heat east of Suez; in the fogs of the Channel,
or under the Southern Cross at Capetown. Nor is
he a mere sojourner on the earth: he has lived for
years in his own house, in England, in Vermont, and
in India, and has had abundant opportunity to
compare the climate of Brattleboro with that of
Bombay.</p>

<p>A born journalist and reporter, his publications
first saw the light in ephemeral Indian sheets. In
the late eighties he began to amuse himself with the
composition of squibs of verse, which he printed in
the local newspaper; these became popular, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
were cited and sung with enthusiasm. Emboldened
by this first taste of success, he put together a
little volume bound like a Government report; he
then sent around reply post-cards for cash orders,
in the fashion already made famous by Walt Whitman.
It is needless to say that copies of this book
command a fancy price to-day. He immediately contracted
what Holmes used to call "lead-poisoning,"
and the sight of his work in type made a literary
career certain. He produced volume after volume,
in both prose and verse, with amazing rapidity, and
his fame overflowed the world. A London periodical
prophesied in 1888, "The book gives hope of a new
literary star of no mean magnitude rising in the East."
The amount and excellence of his output may be
judged when we remember that in the three years
from 1886 to 1889 he published <i>Departmental Ditties</i>,
<i>Plain Tales from the Hills</i>, <i>Soldiers Three</i>, <i>In Black
and White</i>, <i>The Story of the Gadsbys</i>, <i>The Man Who
Would Be King</i>, <i>The Phantom 'Rickshaw</i>, <i>Wee Willie
Winkie</i>, and other narratives.</p>

<p>The originality, freshness, and power of all this
work made Europe stare and gasp. For some years
he had as much notoriety as reputation. We
used to hear of the Kipling "craze," the Kipling
"boom," the Kipling "fad," and Kipling clubs
sprang up like mushrooms. It was difficult to read
him in cool blood, because he was discussed pro and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
con with so much passion. He was fashionable,
in the manner of ping-pong; and there were not
wanting pessimistic prophets who looked upon him
as a comet rather than a fixed star. So late as 1895
a well-known American journal said of him: "Rudyard
Kipling is supposed to be the cleverest man now
handling the pen. The magazines accept everything
he writes, and pay him fabulous prices. Kipling
is now printing a series of Jungle Stories that
are so weak and foolish that we have never been
able to read them. They are not fables: they are
stories of animals talking, and they are pointless,
so far as the average reader is able to judge. We have
asked a good many magazine editors about Kipling's
Jungle Stories; they all express the same astonishment
that the magazine editors accept them. Kipling
will soon be dropped by the magazine editors;
they will inevitably discover that his stories are not
admired by the people. Robert Louis Stevenson
died just in time to save him from the same fate."</p>

<p>Many honestly believed that Mr. Kipling could
write only in flashes; that he was incapable of producing
a complete novel. His answer to this was
<i>The Light that Failed</i>, which, although he
made the mistake of giving it a reversible ending,
indicated that his own lamp had yet sufficient oil.
In 1895 he added immensely to the solidity of his
fame by printing <i>The Brushwood Boy</i>, the scenes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
which he announced previously would be laid in
"England, India, and the world of dreams." Here
he temporarily forsook the land of mysterious horror
for the land of mysterious beauty, and many were
grateful, and said so. In 1896 the appearance of
<i>The Seven Seas</i> proved beyond cavil that he was
something more than a music-hall rimester&mdash;that
he was really among the English poets. The very
next year <i>The Recessional</i> stirred the religious consciousness
of the whole English-speaking race.
And although much of his subsequent career seems
to be a nullification of the sentiment of that poem,
it will remain imperishable when the absent-minded
beggars and the flannelled fools have reached the
oblivion they so richly deserve.</p>

<p>In 1897 he tried his hand for the second time at
a complete novel, <i>Captains Courageous</i>, and the
result might safely be called a success. The moral
of this story will be worth a word or two later on.
The next year an important volume came from his
pen, <i>The Day's Work</i>&mdash;important because it is
in this volume that the new Kipling is first plainly
seen, and the mechanical engineer takes the place
of the literary artist. Such curiosities as <i>The Ship
that Found Herself</i>, <i>The Bridge-Builders</i>, <i>.007</i>,
became anything but curiosities in his later work.
This collection was sadly marred by the inclusion
of such wretched stuff as <i>My Sunday at Home</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<i>An Error in the Fourth Dimension</i>; but it was
glorified by one of the most exquisitely tender and
beautiful of all Mr. Kipling's tales, <i>William the
Conqueror</i>. And it should not be forgotten that the
author saw fit to close this volume with the previously
printed and universally popular <i>Brushwood Boy</i>.
Then, at the very height of his ten years' fame,
Mr. Kipling came closer to death than almost any
other individual has safely done. As he lay sick
with pneumonia in New York, the American people,
whom he has so frequently ridiculed, were more
generally and profoundly affected than they have
been at the bedside of a dying President. The year
1899 marked the great physical crisis of his life,
and seems also to indicate a turning-point in his
literary career.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the relative merits of
Mr. Kipling's early and later style, it is fortunate
for him that the two decades of composition were
not transposed. We all read the early work because
we could not help it; we read his twentieth-century
compositions because he wrote them. It is lucky
that the <i>Plain Tales from the Hills</i> preceded <i>Puck
of Pook's Hill</i>, and that <i>The Light that Failed</i> came
before <i>Stalky and Co.</i> Whether these later productions
could have got into print without the tremendous
prestige of their author's name, is a question
that has all the fascination and all the insolubility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of speculative philosophy. The suddenness of his
early popularity may be perhaps partly accounted
for by the fact that he was working a new
field. The two authors who have most influenced
Mr. Kipling's style are both Americans&mdash;Bret
Harte and Mark Twain; and the analogy between
the sudden fame of Harte and the sudden fame of
Mr. Kipling is too obvious to escape notice. Bret
Harte found in California ore of a different kind
than his maddened contemporaries sought; his
early tales had all the charm of something new and
strange. What Bret Harte made out of California
Mr. Kipling made out of India; at the beginning
he was a "sectional writer," who, with the instinct
of genius, made his literary opportunity out of his
environment. The material was at hand, the time
was ripe, and the man was on the spot. It was the
strong "local colour" in these powerful Indian
tales that captivated readers&mdash;who, in far-away
centres of culture and comfort, delighted to read
of primitive passions in savage surroundings. We
had all the rest and change of air that we could have
obtained in a journey to the Orient, without any
of the expense, discomfort, and peril.</p>

<p>But after the spell of the wizard's imagination
has left us, we cannot help asking, after the manner
of the small boy, Is it true? Are these pictures of
English and native life in India faithful reflexions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of fact? Can we depend on Mr. Kipling for India,
as we can depend (let us say) on Daudet for a
picture of the <i>Rue de la Paix</i>? Now it is a notable
fact that local colour seems most genuine to those
who are unable to verify it. It is a melancholy
truth that the community portrayed by a novelist
not only almost invariably deny the likeness of the
portrait, but that they emphatically resent the
liberty taken. Stories of college life are laughed
to scorn by the young gentlemen described therein,
no matter how fine the local colour may seem to
outsiders. The same is true of social strata in
society, of provincial towns, and Heaven only knows
what the Slums would say to their depiction in
novels, if only the Slums could read. One reason
for this is that a novel or a short story must have
a beginning and an end, and some kind of a plot;
whereas life has no such thing, nor anything remotely
resembling it. When honest people see their daily
lives, made up of thousands of unrelated incidents,
served up to remote readers in the form of an orderly
progression of events, leading up to a proper climax,
the whole thing seems monstrously unreal and untrue.
"Why, we are not in the least like that!"
they cry. And I have purposely omitted the factor
of exaggeration, absolutely essential to the realistic
novelist or playwright.</p>

<p>In a notice of the <i>Plain Tales from the Hills</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
London <i>Saturday Review</i> remarked, "Mr. Kipling
knows and appreciates the English in India." But
it is more interesting and profitable to see how his
stories were regarded in the country he described.
In the <i>Calcutta Times</i>, for 14 September, 1895, there
was a long editorial which is valuable, at any rate,
for the point of view. After mentioning the <i>Plain
Tales</i>, <i>Soldiers Three</i>, <i>Barrack-room Ballads</i>, etc.,
the <i>Times</i> critic said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Except in a few instances which might easily be numbered
on the fingers of one hand, nothing in the books we have
named is at all likely to live or deserves to live.... It will
probably be answered that this sweeping condemnation is
not of much value against the emphatic approval of the British
public and the aforesaid chorus of critics in praise of the new
Genius.... And the English critics have this to plead in
excuse of their hyperbolical appreciation of the Stronger
Dickens, that his first work came to them fathered with responsible
guarantee from men who should have known better,
that it was in the way of a revelation of Anglo-Indian society,
a-letting in the light of truth on places which had been very
dark indeed.</p>

<p>"Now the average English critic knows very little of the
intricacies of social life in India, and in the enthusiasm which
Mrs. Hauksbee and kindred creations inspired he accepted
too readily as true types what are, in fact, caricatures, or distorted
presentments, of some of the more poisonous social
characteristics to be found in Anglo-Indian as well as in every
other civilised society.... Do not let us be understood
as recklessly running down Kipling and all his works....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
He possesses in a high degree the power of describing a certain
class of emotions, and the flights of his imagination in some
directions are extremely bold and original. In such tales,
for instance, as 'The Man who would be a King' (<i>sic</i>) and
'The Ride of Morrowby Jukes' (<i>sic</i>) there are qualities of
the imagination which equal, if they do not surpass, anything
in the same line with which we are acquainted.... The
capital charge, in the opinion of many, the head and front
of his offending, is that he has traduced a whole society, and
has spread libels broadcast. Anglo-Indian society may in
some respects be below the average level of the best society
in the Western world, where the rush and stir of life and the
collision of intellects combine to keep the atmosphere clearer
and more bracing than in this land of tennis, office boxes,
frontier wars, and enervation. But as far as it falls below
what many would wish it to be, so far it rises above the description
of it which now passes current at home under the
sanction of Kipling's name.... For whether Kipling is
treating of Indian subjects pure and simple, of Anglo-Indian
subjects, or is attempting a Western theme, the personality
of the writer is pervasive and intrusive everywhere, with all
its limitations of vision and information, as well as with its
eternal panoply of cheap smartness and spiced vulgarity....
Smartness is always first with him, and Truth may shift for
herself."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although the writer of the above article is somewhat
blinded by prejudice and wrath, it is, nevertheless,
interesting testimony from the particular
section of our planet which Mr. Kipling was at that
time supposed to know best. And out in San
Francisco they are still talking of Mr. Kipling's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
visit there, and the "abominable libel" of California
life and customs he chose to publish in <i>From Sea
to Sea</i>.</p>

<p>Apart from Mr. Kipling's good fortune in having
fresh material to deal with, the success of his early
work lay chiefly in its dominant quality&mdash;Force.
For the last thirty years, the world has been full of
literary experts, professional story-writers, to whom
the pen is a means of livelihood. Our magazines
are crowded with tales which are well written, and
nothing else. They say nothing, because their
writers have nothing to say. The impression left
on the mind by the great majority of handsomely
bound novels is like that of a man who beholds his
natural face in a glass. The thing we miss is
the thing we unconsciously demand&mdash;Vitality. In
the rare instances where vitality is the ground-quality,
readers forgive all kinds of excrescences
and defects, as they did twenty years ago in Mr.
Kipling, and later, for example, in Jack London.
The original vigour and strength of Mr. Kipling's
stories were to the jaded reader a keen, refreshing
breeze; like Marlowe in Elizabethan days he seemed
a towering, robust, masculine personality, who had
at his command an inexhaustible supply of material
absolutely new. This undoubted vigour was naturally
unaccompanied by moderation and good
taste; Mr. Kipling's sins against artistic proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and the law of subtle suggestion were black indeed.
He simply had no reserve. In <i>The Man Who
Would Be King</i>, which I have always regarded as
his masterpiece, the subject was so big that no
reserve in handling it was necessary. The whole
thing was an inspiration, of imagination all compact.
But in many other instances his style was altogether
too loud for his subject. One wearies of eternal
fortissimo. Many of his tales should have been
printed throughout in italics. In examples of this
nature, which are all too frequent in the "Complete
Works" of Mr. Kipling, the tragedy becomes melodrama;
the humour becomes buffoonery; the picturesque
becomes bizarre; the terrible becomes horrible;
and vulgarity reigns supreme.</p>

<p>He is far better in depicting action than in portraying
character. This is one reason why his
short stories are better than his novels. In <i>The
Light that Failed</i>, with all its merits, he never realised
the character of Maisie; but in his tales of violent
action, we feel the vividness of the scene, time and
again. His work here is effective, because Mr.
Kipling has an acute sense of the value of words,
just as a great musician has a correct ear for the
value of pitch. When one takes the trouble to analyse
his style in his most striking passages, it all comes
down to skill in the use of the specific word&mdash;the
word that makes the picture clear, sometimes intolerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
clear. Look at the nouns and adjectives
in this selection from <i>The Drums of the Fore and Aft</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"They then selected their men, and slew them with deep
gasps and short hacking coughs, and groanings of leather
belts against strained bodies, and realised for the first time
that an Afghan attacked is far less formidable than an Afghan
attacking; which fact old soldiers might have told them.</p>

<p>"But they had no old soldiers in their ranks."</p></blockquote>

<p>There are two defects in Mr. Kipling's earlier work
that might perhaps be classed as moral deficiencies.
One is the almost ever present coarseness, which the
author mistook for vigour. Now the tendency to
coarseness is inseparable from force, and needs to
be held in check. Coarseness is the inevitable excrescence
of superabundant vitality, just as effeminacy
is the danger limit of delicacy and refinement.
Swift and Rabelais had the coarseness of a robust
English sailor; at their worst they are simply abominable,
just as Tennyson at his worst is effeminate
and silly. Mr. Kipling has that natural delight
in coarseness that all strong natures have, whether
they are willing to admit it or not. A large proportion
of his scenes of humour are devoted to
drunkenness: "gloriously drunk" is a favourite
phrase with him. The time may come when this
sort of humour will be obsolete. We laugh at
drunkenness, as the Elizabethans laughed at insanity,
but we are only somewhat nearer real civilisation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
than they. At any rate, even those who delight in
scenes of intoxication must find the theme rather
overworked in Mr. Kipling. This same defect in
him leads to indulgence in his passion for ghastly
detail. This is where he ceases to be a man of letters,
and becomes downright journalistic. It is easier
to excite momentary attention by physical horror
than by any other device; and Mr. Kipling is determined
to leave nothing to the imagination. Many
instances might be cited; we need only recall the
gouging out of a man's eye in <i>The Light that Failed</i>,
and the human brains on the boot in <i>Badalia Herodsfoot</i>.</p>

<p>The other moral defect in this early work was its
world-weary cynicism, which was simply foolish
in so young a writer. His treatment of women, for
example, compares unfavourably with that shown
in the frankest tales of Bret Harte. His attitude
toward women in these youthful books has been
well described as "disillusioned gallantry." The
author continually gives the reader a "knowing
wink," which, after a time, gets on one's nerves.
These books, after all, were probably not meant
for women to read, and perhaps no one was more
surprised than Mr. Kipling himself at the rapturous
exclamations of the thousands of his feminine adorers.
A woman rejoicing in the perusal of these Indian
tales seems as much out of place as she does in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
office of a cheap country hotel, reeking with the
fumes of whiskey and stale tobacco, and adorned
with men who spit with astonishing accuracy into
distant receptacles.</p>

<p>Mr. Kipling doubtless knows more about his own
faults than any of the critics; and if after one has
read <i>The Light that Failed</i> for the sake of the story,
one rereads it attentively as an <i>Apologia Pro Vita
Sua</i>, one will be surprised to see how many ideas
about his art he has put into the mouth of Dick.
"Under any circumstances, remember, four-fifths
of everybody's work must be bad. But the remnant
is worth the trouble for its own sake." "One must
do something always. You hang your canvas up
in a palm-tree and let the parrots criticise." "If
we sit down quietly to work out notions that are sent
to us, we may or we may not do something that
isn't bad. A great deal depends on being master
of the bricks and mortar of the trade. But the instant
we begin to think about success and the effect
of our work&mdash;to play with one eye on the gallery&mdash;we
lose power and touch and everything else....
I was told that all the world was interested in my
work, and everybody at Kami's talked turpentine,
and I honestly believed that the world needed elevating
and influencing, and all manner of impertinences,
by my brushes. By Jove, I actually believed that!...
And when it's done it's such a tiny thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and the world's so big, and all but a millionth part
of it doesn't care."</p>

<p>Fortunately, four-fifths of Kipling's work isn't
bad. We are safe in ascribing genius to the man
who wrote <i>The Phantom 'Rickshaw</i>, <i>The Strange
Ride</i>, <i>The Man Who Would Be King</i>, <i>William the
Conqueror</i>, <i>The Brushwood Boy</i>, and <i>The Jungle
Book</i>. These, and many other tales, to say nothing
of his poetry, constitute an astounding achievement
for a writer under thirty-five.</p>

<p>But the Kipling of the last ten years is an Imperialist
and a Mechanic, rather than a literary man.
We need not classify <i>Stalky and Co.</i>, except to say
that it is probably the worst novel ever written by
a man of genius. It is on a false pitch throughout,
and the most rasping book of recent times. The
only good things in it are the quotations from
Browning. The Jingo in Mr. Kipling was released
by the outbreak of the South African War, and the
author of <i>The Recessional</i> forgot everything he had
prayed God to remember. He became the voice
of the British Empire, and the man who had always
ridiculed Americans for bunkum oratory, out-screamed
us all. In this imperialistic verse and
prose there is not much literature, but there is a great
deal of noise, which has occasionally deceived the
public; just as an orator is sure of a round of applause
if his peroration is shouted at the top of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
voice. His recent book, <i>Puck of Pook's Hill</i>, is
written against the grain; painful effort has supplied
the place of the old inspiration, and the simplicity
of true art is conspicuous by its absence. Of this
volume, <i>The Athenæum</i>, in general friendly to
Kipling, remarks: "In his new part&mdash;the missionary
of empire&mdash;Mr. Kipling is living the strenuous
life. He has frankly abandoned story-telling,
and is using his complete and powerful armory in
the interest of patriotic zeal." On the other hand,
Mr. Owen Wister, whose opinion is valuable, thinks
<i>Puck</i> "the highest plane that he has ever reached"&mdash;a
judgement that I record with respect, though
to me it is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Kipling the Mechanic is less useful than an encyclopædia,
and not any more interesting. A comic
paper describes him as "now a technical expert;
at one time a popular writer. This young man was
born in India, came to his promise in America, and
lost himself in England. His <i>Plain Tales of the
Hills</i> (<i>sic</i>) has been succeeded by <i>Enigmatical
Expositions from the Dark Valleys</i>.... Mr. Kipling
has declared that the Americans have never
forgiven him for not dying in their country. On the
contrary, they have never forgiven him for not having
written anything better since he was here than he
did before. But while there's Kipling, there's hope."
It is to be earnestly hoped that he will cease describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the machinery of automobiles, ships, locomotives,
and flying air-vessels, and once more look in his heart
and write. His worst enemy is himself. He seems to
be in terror lest he should say something ordinary
and commonplace. He has been so praised for his
originality and powerful imagination, that his later
books give one the impression of a man writing in
the sweat of his face, with the grim determination
to make every sentence a literary event. Such a
tale as <i>Wireless</i> shows that the zeal for originality
has eaten him up. One can feel on every page the
straining for effect, and it is as exhausting to read
as it is to watch a wrestling-match, and not nearly
so entertaining. If Mr. Kipling goes on in the vein
of these later years, he may ultimately survive his
reputation, as many a good man has done before
him. I should think even now, when the author
of <i>Puck of Pook's Hill</i> turns over the pages of <i>The
Man Who Would Be King</i>, he would say with Swift,
"Good God! what a genius I had when I wrote that
book!"</p>

<p>His latest collection of tales, with the significant
title, <i>Actions and Reactions</i>, is a particularly welcome
volume to those of us who prefer the nineteenth
century Kipling to the twentieth. To be
sure, the story <i>With the Night Mail</i>, shows the new
mechanical cleverness rather than the old inspiration;
it is both ingenious and ephemeral, and should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
have remained within the covers of the magazine
where it first appeared. Furthermore, <i>A Deal in
Cotton</i>, <i>The Puzzler</i>, and <i>Little Foxes</i> are neither
clever nor literary; they are merely irritating, and
remind us of a book we would gladly forget, called
<i>Traffics and Discoveries</i>. But the first narrative in
this new volume, with the caption, <i>An Habitation
Enforced</i>, is one of the most subtle, charming, and
altogether delightful things that Mr. Kipling has
ever given us; nor has he ever brought English and
American people in conjunction with so much
charity and good feeling. I do not think he has
previously shown greater psychological power than
in this beautiful story. In the second tale, <i>Garm&mdash;A
Hostage</i>, Mr. Kipling joins the ranks of the dog
worshippers; the exploits of this astonishing canine
will please all dog-owners, and many others as well.
Naturally he has to exaggerate; instead of making his
four-footed hero merely intelligent, he makes him
noble in reason, infinite in faculty, in apprehension
like a god, the paragon of animals. But it is a
brilliant piece of work. The last story, <i>The House
Surgeon</i>, takes us into the world of spirit, whither
Mr. Kipling has successfully conducted his readers
before. This mysterious domain seems to have a
constantly increasing attraction for modern realistic
writers, and has enormously enlarged the stock of
material for contemporary novelists. The field is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the world, yes; but the world is bigger than it used
to be, bigger than any boundaries indicated by maps
or globes. It would be interesting to speculate just
what the influence of all these transcendental excursions
will be on modern fiction as an educational force.
Mr. Kipling apparently writes with sincere conviction,
and in a powerfully impressive manner. The
poetic interludes in this volume, like those in <i>Puck
of Pook's Hill</i>, show that the author's skill in verse
has not in the least abated; the lines on <i>The Power
of the Dog</i> are simply irresistible. It is safe to say
that <i>Actions and Reactions</i> will react favourably on
all unprejudiced readers; and for this relief much
thanks. If one wishes to observe the difference between
the inspired and the ingenious Mr. Kipling,
one has only to read this collection straight through.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Like almost all Anglo-Saxon writers, Mr. Kipling
is a moralist, and his gospel is Work. He believes
in the strenuous life as a cure-all. He apparently
does not agree with Goethe that To Be is greater than
To Do. The moral of <i>Captains Courageous</i> is
the same moral contained in the ingenious bee-hive
story. The unpardonable sin is Idleness. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
although Work is good for humanity, it is rather
limited as an ideal, and we cannot rate Mr. Kipling
very high as a spiritual teacher. God is not always
in the wind, or in the earthquake, or in the fire. The
day-dreams of men like Stevenson and Thackeray
sometimes bear more fruit than the furious energy
of Mr. Kipling.</p>

<p>But the consuming ambition of this man, and his
honest desire to do his best, will, let us hope, spare
him the humiliation of being beaten by his own
past. After all, Genius is the rarest article in the
world, and one who undoubtedly has it is far more
likely to reach the top of the hill than he is to take
the road to Danger, which leads into a great wood;
or the road to Destruction, which leads into a wide
field, full of dark mountains.</p>

<p class="center big">"LORNA DOONE"</p>


<p>The air of Devon and Somerset is full of literary
germs. The best advice a London hack could give
to a Gigadibs would be <i>Go west, young man</i>. The
essential thing is to establish a residence south of
Bristol, grow old along with Wessex, and inhale
the atmosphere. Thousands of reverent pilgrims,
on foot, on bicycle, and in automobile, are yearly
following the tragic trails of Mr. Hardy's heroines;
to a constantly increasing circle of interested observers,
Mr. Eden Phillpotts is making the topography
of Devon clearer than an ordnance map;
if Mrs. Willcocks writes a few more novels like
<i>The Wingless Victory</i> and <i>A Man of Genius</i>, we
shall soon all be talking about her&mdash;just wait and
see; and in the summer season, when soft is the sun,
the tops of coaches in North Devon and Somerset
are packed with excited Americans, carrying Lornas
instead of Baedekers. To the book-loving tourists,
every inch of this territory is holy ground.</p>

<p>Yet the author of our favourite romance was not
by birth a Wessex man. Mr. Richard D. Blackmore
(for, like the creator of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
name is not nearly so well known as his work)
first "saw the light" in Berkshire, the year being
1825. But he was exposed to the Wessex germs
at the critical period of boyhood, actually going to
Blundell's School at Tiverton, a small town in the
heart of Devonshire, fourteen miles north of Exeter,
at the union of Exe and Lowman rivers. To this
same school he sent John Ridd, as we learn in the
second paragraph of the novel:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"John Ridd, the elder, churchwarden, and overseer, being
a great admirer of learning, and well able to write his name,
sent me, his only son, to be schooled at Tiverton, in the
County of Devon. For the chief boast of that ancient town
(next to its woolen staple) is a worthy grammar-school, the
largest in the west of England, founded and handsomely
endowed in the year 1604 by Master Peter Blundell, of that
same place, clothier."</p></blockquote>

<p>From this institution young Blackmore proceeded
to Exeter College, Oxford, where he laid the foundations
of his English style by taking high rank in the
classics. Like many potential poets and novelists,
he studied law, and was called to the bar in 1852.
But he cared little for the dusty purlieus of the
Middle Temple, and not at all for city life: his
father was a country parson, as it is the fashion for
English fathers of men of letters to be, and the young
man loved the peace and quiet of rural scenery.
He finally made a home at Teddington, in Middlesex,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and devoted himself to the avocation of fruit-growing.
On this subject he became an authority,
and his articles on gardening were widely read.
Here he died in January, 1900.</p>

<p>His death was mourned by many thousand persons
who never saw him, and who knew nothing about his
life. The public always loves the makers of its
favourite books; but in the case of Mr. Blackmore,
every reader of his masterpiece felt a peculiarly
intimate relation with the man who wrote it. The
story is so full of the milk of human kindness, its
hero and heroine are so irresistibly attractive, and
it radiates so wholesome and romantic a charm,
that one cannot read it without feeling on the best
possible terms with the author&mdash;as if both were
intimate friends of long standing. For <i>Lorna Doone</i>
is a book we think we have always been reading; we
can hardly recall the time when it had not become
a part of our literary experience; just as it takes an
effort to remember that there were days and years
when we were not even aware of the existence of
persons who are now indissolubly close. They
have since become so necessary that we imagine life
before we knew them must really have been more
barren than it seemed.</p>

<p>Like many successful novelists, Mr. Blackmore
began his literary career by the publication of verse,
several volumes of poems appearing from his pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
during the years 1854-1860. Although he never
entirely abandoned verse composition, which it
was only too apparent that he wrote with his left
hand, the coolness with which his Muse was received
may have been a cause of his attempting the quite
different art of the novel. It is pleasant to remember,
however, that in these early years he translated
Vergil's <i>Georgics</i>; combining his threefold love of
the classics, of poetry, and of gardening. Of how
much practical agricultural value he found the
Mantuan bard, we shall never know.</p>

<p>Contrary to a common supposition, <i>Lorna Doone</i>
was not his first story. He launched two ventures
before his masterpiece&mdash;<i>Clara Vaughan</i> in 1864,
and <i>Cradock Nowell</i> in 1866. These won no applause,
and have not emerged from the congenial
oblivion in which they speedily foundered. After
these false starts, the great book came out in 1869,
with no blare of publisher's trumpet, with scanty
notice from the critics, and with no notice of any kind
from the public. In the preface to the twentieth
edition, and his various prefaces are well worth
reading, the author remarked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"What a lucky maid you are, my Lorna! When first you
came from the Western Moors nobody cared to look at you;
the 'leaders of the public taste' led none of it to make test
of you. Having struggled to the light of day, through obstruction
and repulses, for a year and a half you shivered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
a cold corner, without a sun-ray. Your native land disdained
your voice, and America answered, 'No child of mine';
knowing how small your value was, you were glad to get your
fare paid to any distant colony."</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Saturday Review</i> for 5 November, 1870,
uttered a few patronising words of praise. The
book was called "a work of real excellence," but
the reviewer timidly added, "We do not pretend
to rank it with the acknowledged masterpieces of
fiction." On the whole, there is good ground
for gratitude that the public was so slow to see the
"real excellence" of <i>Lorna</i>. A sudden blaze of
popularity is sometimes so fierce as to consume its
cause. Let us spend a few moments in devout
meditation, while we recall the ashes of "the book
of the year." The gradual dawn of Lorna's fame
has assured her of a long and fair day.</p>

<p>Possibly one of the reasons why this great romance
made so small an impression was because it appeared
at an unpropitious time. The sower sowed
the seed; but the thorns of Reade and Trollope
sprang up and choked them. These two novelists
were in full action; and they kept the public busy.
Realism was strong in the market; people did not
know then, as we do now, that The <i>Cloister and
the Hearth</i> was worth all the rest of Charles Reade
put together. Had <i>Lorna Doone</i> appeared toward
the end of the century, when the Romantic Revival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
was in full swing, it would have received a royal
welcome. But how many would have recognised
its superiority to the tinsel stuff of those recent days,
full of galvanised knights and stuffed chatelaines?
For <i>Lorna</i> belongs to a class of fiction with which
we were flooded in the nineties, though, compared
with the ordinary representative of its kind, it is
as a star to a glow-worm. Readers then enjoyed
impossible characters, whose talk was mainly of
"gramercy" and similar curiosities, for they had
the opportunity to "revel in the glamour of a bogus
antiquity." But an abundance of counterfeits
does not lower the value of the real metal; and
<i>Lorna</i> is a genuine coin struck from the mint of
historical romance. In the original preface its
author modestly said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"This work is called a 'romance,' because the incidents,
characters, time, and scenery are alike romantic. And in
shaping this old tale, the writer neither dares, nor desires,
to claim for it the dignity or cumber it with the difficulty of
an historic novel."</p></blockquote>

<p>In warmth and colour, in correct visualisation, and
in successful imitation of the prose of a bygone
day (which no one has ever perfectly accomplished),
it ranks not very far below the greatest of all English
historical romances, <i>Henry Esmond</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lorna Doone</i> is practically one more illustration
of Single-Speech Hamilton. After its appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
its author wrote and published steadily for thirty
years; but the fact remains that not only is <i>Lorna</i>
his best-known work, but that his entire reputation
hangs upon it. Many of his other stories
are good, notably <i>Cripps the Carrier</i> and <i>Perlycross</i>;
the latter has a most ingenious plot; but
these two now peacefully repose with their mates
in undisturbed slumber at dusty library corners.
They had an initial sale because they came from
the hand that created <i>Lorna</i>; then they were lost
in the welter of ephemeral literature. Mr. Blackmore
offered his buyers all sorts of wares, but, after
a momentary examination, they declined what was
"just as good," and returned to their favourite,
which, by the way, was never his; he ranked it
third among his productions.</p>

<p>For this novel is not only one of the best-loved
books in English fiction, and stands magnificently
the severe test of rereading, it is bound to have
even more admirers in the future than it has ever
yet enjoyed; it is visibly growing in reputation every
year. It may be interesting to analyse some of its
elements, in order to understand what has given it
so assured a place. The main plot is simplicity
itself. It is a history, however, that the world has
always found entertaining, the history of the love
of a strong man for a beautiful girl. They meet,
he falls in love, he rescues her from peril, she goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
up to London, becomes a great lady, returns, is
dangerously wounded on her wedding-day, recovers,
and they live happily for ever after&mdash;<i>voilà tout</i>.
A very simple plot, yet the telling fills two stout
volumes, with the reader's interest maintained from
first to last.</p>

<p>It is told in the first person&mdash;the approved method
of the historical romance. Professor Raleigh has admirably
pointed out the virtues and defects of the
three ways of composing a novel,&mdash;direct discourse
by the chief actor, the exclusive employment of letters,
and the "invisible and omniscient" impersonal
author.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is interesting to note, in passing, that
our first English novelist, Defoe, adopted the first
method; Richardson, our second novelist, took the
second; and Fielding, our third novelist, took the
third. Now, the great advantage of having John
Ridd speak throughout is the gain in reality and
vividness; it is as though we sat with him in the
ingle, and obtained all our information at first hand.
What is lost by narrowness of experience is made up
in intensity; we follow him breathlessly, as Desdemona
followed Othello, and he has every moment
our burning sympathy. We participate more fully
in his joys and sorrows, in the agony of his suspense;
we share his final triumph. He is talking directly to
us, and John Ridd is a good talker. He is the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of man who appeals to all classes of listeners. He
has the gentleness and modesty that are so becoming
to great physical strength; the love of children,
animals, and all helpless creatures; reverence for
God, purity of heart, and a noble slowness to wrath.
Such a man is simply irresistible, and we are sorry
when he finishes his tale. The defect in this method
of narration, which Mr. Blackmore has employed
with such success, is the inevitable defect in all
stories written in this manner, as Professor Raleigh
has observed: "It takes from the novelist the privilege
of killing his hero." When John Ridd is
securely bound, and the guns of hostile soldiers are
levelled at his huge bulk, with their fingers actually
on the triggers, we laugh at ourselves for our high-beating
hearts; for of course he is unkillable, else
how could he be talking at this very moment?</p>

<p>The plot of <i>Lorna Doone</i>, which, as we have observed,
is very simple, is, nevertheless, skilfully
complicated. It is not a surprise plot, like that of
<i>A Pair of Blue Eyes</i>; we are not stunned by the
last page. It is a suspense plot; we have a well-founded
hope that all will come right in the end,
and yet the author has introduced enough disturbing
elements to put us occasionally in a maze. This
artistic suspense is attained partly by the method
of direct discourse; which, at the same time, develops
the character of the hero. Big John repeats incidents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
dwells lengthily on minute particulars,
stops to enjoy the scenery, and makes mountains of
stories out of molehills of fact. The second complication
of the plot arises from the introduction of
characters that apparently divert the course of the
story without really doing so. There are nineteen
important characters, all held well in hand; and a
conspicuous example of a complicating personage is
little Ruth Huckaback. She interferes in the main
plot in an exceedingly clever way. The absorbing
question in every reader's mind is, of course, Will
John marry Lorna? Now Ruth's interviews with
the hero are so skilfully managed, and with such
intervals of time between, that on some pages she
seems destined to be his bride. And, admirably
drawn as her character is, when her artistic purpose
in the plot is fully accomplished, she quietly fades
out, with the significant tribute, "Ruth Huckaback
is not married yet."</p>

<p>There is also a subsidiary plot, dovetailed neatly
into the main building. This is the story of the
attractive highwayman, Tom Faggus, and his love
for John's sister, Annie. Many pages are taken
up with the adventures of this gentleman, who enters
the novel on horseback (what a horse!) at the moment
when the old drake is fighting for his life.
Besides our interest in Tom himself, in his wild
adventures, and in his reformation, we are interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
in the conflict of his two passions, one for the
bottle, and one for Annie, and we wonder which will
win. This subsidiary love story is still further complicated
by the introduction of young De Whichehalse;
and in the struggle between John Ridd and
the Doones, both Tom Faggus and the De Whichehalse
family play important parts. It is interesting,
too, to observe how events that seem at the time to
be of no particular importance, turn out later to
be highly significant; when, at the very beginning
of the long story, the little boy, on his way home
from school, meets the lady's maid, and shortly
after sees the child borne away on the robber's
saddle, we imagine all this is put in to enliven the
journey, that it is just "detail"; long afterwards
we find the artistic motive. In fact, one of the most
notable virtues of this admirable plot is the constant
introduction of matters apparently irrelevant and
due to mere garrulity, such as the uncanny sound,
for example, which prove after all to be essential
to the course of the narrative.</p>

<p>As for the characters, they impress us differently
in different moods. For all John Ridd's prodigious
strength, marvellous escapes, and astounding feats,
his personality is so intensely human that he seems
real. His <i>soul</i>, at any rate, is genuine, and wholly
natural; his bodily activity&mdash;the extraction of
Carver's biceps, the wrenching of the branch from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the tree, the hurling of the cannon through the door&mdash;makes
him a dim giant in a fairy story. When
we think of the qualities of his mind and heart,
he comes quite close; when we think of his physical
prowess, he almost vanishes in the land of Fable.
I remember the comment of an undergraduate&mdash;"John
Ridd is as remote as Achilles; he is like a
Greek myth."</p>

<p>The women are all well drawn and individualised&mdash;except
the heroine. I venture to say that no one
has ever seen Lorna in his mind's eye. She is like a
plate that will not develop. A very pretty girl with
an affectionate disposition,&mdash;what more can be said?
But so long as a Queen has beauty and dignity, she
does not need to be interesting; and Lorna is the
queen of this romance. John's mother and his two
sisters are as like and unlike as members of the same
family ought to be; they are real women. Ruth
Huckaback and Gwenny Carfax are great additions
to our literary acquaintances; each would make
an excellent heroine for a realistic novel. They have
the indescribable puzzling characteristics that we
call feminine; sudden caprices, flashes of unexpected
jealousy, deep loyal tenderness, unlimited
capacity for self-sacrifice, and in the last analysis,
Mystery.</p>

<p>The humour of the story is spontaneous, and of
great variety, running from broad mirth to whimsical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
subtlety. The first concerted attack on the
Doones is comic opera burlesque; but the scenes
of humour that delight us most are those describing
friendly relations with beast and bird. The eye of
the old drake, as he stared wildly from his precarious
position, and the delight of the ducks as they welcomed
his rescue; above all, Annie's care of the
wild birds in the bitter cold.</p>

<blockquote><p>"There was not a bird but knew her well, after one day
of comforting; and some would come to her hand, and sit,
and shut one eye, and look at her. Then she used to stroke
their heads, and feel their breasts, and talk to them; and
not a bird of them all was there but liked to have it done to
him. And I do believe they would eat from her hand things
unnatural to them, lest she should be grieved and hurt by
not knowing what to do for them. One of them was a noble
bird, such as I had never seen before, of very fine bright
plumage, and larger than a missel-thrush. He was the hardest
of all to please; and yet he tried to do his best."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever may be the merits of Mr. Blackmore's
published verse, there is more poetry in <i>Lorna Doone</i>
than in many volumes of formal rime. The wonderful
descriptions of the country in shade and shine,
in fog and drought, the pictures of the sunrise and
the falling water, the "tumultuous privacy" of the
snow-storms,&mdash;these are all descriptive poems.
Every reader has noticed the peculiar rhythm of
the style, and wondered if it were intentional.
Hundreds of sentences here and there are perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
English hexameters; one can find them by opening
the book at random, and reading aloud. But this
peculiar element in the style goes much farther than
isolated phrases. There are solid passages of steady
rhythm, which might correctly be printed in verse
form.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Blackmore's personal character was so modest,
unassuming, and lovable, that it is not difficult to
guess the source of the purity, sweetness, and
sincerity of his great book. If he were somewhat
surprised at the utter coldness of its first reception,
he never got over his amazement at the size and
extent of its ultimate triumph. In the preface to
the sixth edition, he said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Few things have surprised me more, and nothing has more
pleased me, than the great success of this simple tale....
Therefore any son of Devon may imagine, and will not grudge,
the writer's delight at hearing from a recent visitor to the west,
that '<i>Lorna Doone</i>, to a Devonshire man, is as good as clotted
cream, almost!'</p>

<p>"Although not half so good as that, it has entered many a
tranquil, happy, pure, and hospitable home; and the author,
while deeply grateful for this genial reception, ascribes it
partly to the fact that his story contains no word or thought
disloyal to its birthright in the fairest county of England."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Blackmore lived long enough to see an entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
different kind of "local colour" become conventional,
where many a novelist, portraying his native
town or the community in which he dwelt, emphasised
with what skill he could command all its poverty,
squalor, and meanness; the disgusting vices and
malignant selfishness of its inhabitants; and after
he had thus fouled his nest by representing it as
a mass of filth, degradation, and sin, he imagined
he had created a work of art. The author of <i>Lorna
Doone</i> had the satisfaction of knowing that he had
inspired hundreds of thousands of readers with the
love of his favourite west country, and with an
intense desire to visit it. And being, like John
Ridd, of a forgiving nature, he forgave America for
its early neglect of his story; for being informed
of the supremacy of <i>Lorna Doone</i> in the hearts of
American undergraduates, he remarked, in a letter
to the present writer, "The good word of the young,
who are at once the most intelligent and the most
highly educated of a vast intellectual nation, augurs
well for the continuance&mdash;at least for a generation&mdash;of
my fortunate production."</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_A" id="APPENDIX_A"></a>APPENDIX A</h2>

<p class="center big">NOVELS AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY</p>


<p>Some fourteen years ago, in the pamphlet of elective
courses of study open to the senior and junior classes
of Yale College, I announced a new course called
"Modern Novels." The course and its teacher
immediately became the object of newspaper notoriety,
which spells academic damnation. From
every State in the Union long newspaper clippings
were sent to me, in which my harmless little pedagogical
scheme was discussed&mdash;often under enormous
headlines&mdash;as a revolutionary idea. It was
praised by some, denounced by others, but thoroughly
advertised, so that, for many months, I received
letters from all parts of the Western Hemisphere,
asking for the list of novels read and the method
pursued in studying them. During six months
these letters averaged three a day, and they came
from the north, south, east, and west, from Alaska,
Hawaii, Central and South America. The dust
raised by all this hubbub crossed the Atlantic.
The course was gravely condemned in a column
editorial in the London <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
received the crowning honour of a parody in
<i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>Things have changed somewhat in the last ten
years, and although I have never repeated my one
year's experiment, I believe that it would be perfectly
safe to do so. Not only does the production of new
novels continue at constantly accelerating speed,
but critical books on the novel have begun to increase
and multiply in all directions. At least twenty such
works now stand on my shelves, the latest of which
(by Selden L. Whitcomb) is frankly called "The
Study of a Novel," and boldly begins: "This volume
is the result of practical experience in teaching the
novel, and its aim is primarily pedagogical."</p>

<p>The objections usually formulated against novels
as a university study are about as follows: (<i>a</i>) the
study of fiction is unacademic&mdash;that is, lacking in
dignity; (<i>b</i>) students will read too many novels
anyway, and the emphasis should therefore be thrown
on other forms of literary art; (<i>c</i>) most recent and
contemporary fiction is worthless, and if novels are
to be taught at all, the titles selected should be
confined entirely to recognised classics; (<i>d</i>) many
of the novels of to-day are immoral, and the reading
of them will corrupt rather than develop adolescent
minds; (<i>e</i>) they are too "easy," too interesting, and
a course confined to them is totally lacking in mental
discipline. These objections, each and all, contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
some truth, and demand a serious answer.</p>

<p>That the study of fiction is unacademic is a weighty
argument, but its weight is the mass of custom and
prejudice rather than solid thought. In old times,
the curriculum had little to do with real life, so that
the most scholarly professors and the most promising
pupils were often plentifully lacking in common sense.
Students gifted with real independence of mind,
marked with an alert interest in the life and thought
about them, chafed irritably under the old-fashioned
course of study, and often treated it with neglect or
open rebellion. What Thomas Gray said of the
Cambridge curriculum constitutes a true indictment
against eighteenth-century universities; and it was
not until very recent times that such studies as history,
European literature, modern languages, political
economy, natural sciences, and the fine arts were
thought to have equal academic dignity with the
trinity of Latin, Greek, and mathematics. There
are, indeed, many able and conscientious men who
still believe that this trinity cannot be successfully
rivalled by any other possible group of studies.
Now the novel is the most prominent form of modern
literary art; and if modern literature is to be studied
at all, fiction cannot be overlooked. The profound
change brought about in university curricula, caused
largely by the elective system, is simply the bringing
of college courses of study into closer contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
human life, and the recognition that what young men
need is a general preparation to live a life of active
usefulness in modern social relations.</p>

<p>That students read too many novels anyway&mdash;that
is, in proportion to their reading in history and
biography&mdash;is probably true. But the primary
object of a course in novel-reading is not to make
the student read more novels, instead of less, nor to
substitute the reading of fiction for the reading of
other books. The real object is (after a cheerful recognition
of the fact that he will read novels anyway)
to persuade him to read them intelligently,
to observe the difference between good novels and
bad, and so to become impatient and disgusted with
cheap, sensational, and counterfeit specimens of
the novelist's art.</p>

<p>That much of contemporary fiction is worthless,
and that the novels selected should be classics, is
a twofold statement, of which the first phrase is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
true and the second a <i>non sequitur</i>. Much ancient
and mediæval literature read in college is worthless
in itself; it is read because it illustrates the language,
or represents some literary form, or because it throws
light on the customs and ideas of the time. The fact
that a certain obscure work was written in the year
1200 does not necessarily prove that it is more
valuable for study than one written in 1909. Now
it so happens that the modern novel has become
more and more the mirror of modern ideas; and for
a student who really wishes to know what people are
thinking about all over the world to-day, the novels
of Tolstoi, Björnson, Sudermann, and Thomas Hardy
cannot wisely be neglected. Why should the study
of the contemporary novel and the contemporary
drama be tabooed when in other departments of research
the aim is to be as contemporary as possible?
We have courses in social conditions that actually
investigate slums. I am not for a moment pleading
that the study of modern novels and modern art
should supplant the study of immortal masterpieces;
but merely that they should have their rightful
place, and not be regarded either with contempt
or as unworthy of serious treatment. The two
most beneficial ways to study a novel are to
regard it, first, as an art-form, and secondly as a
manifestation of intellectual life; from neither point
of view should the contemporary novel be wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
neglected.</p>

<p>That many of the novels of to-day are immoral
is true, but it is still more true of the classics. The
proportion of really immoral books to the total production
is probably less to-day than it ever was
before; in fact, there are an immense number of
excellent contemporary novels which are spotless,
something that cannot be said of the classics of antiquity
or of the great majority of literary works published
prior to the nineteenth century. If immorality
be the cry, what shall we say about Aristophanes or
Ovid? How does the case stand with the comedies
of Dryden or with the novels of Henry Fielding?
No, it is undoubtedly true that the teacher who
handles modern fiction can more easily find a combination
of literary excellence and purity of tone than
he could in any previous age.</p>

<p>That a course in novels lacks mental discipline
and is too easy depends mainly on the teacher and
his method. As regards the time consumed in
preparation, it is probable that a student would
expend three or four times the number of hours
on a course in novels than he would in ancient
languages, where, unfortunately, the use of a
translation is all but universal; and the translation
is fatal to mental discipline. But it is
not merely a matter of hours; novels can be
taught in such a way as to produce the best kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of mental discipline, which consists, first, in compelling
a student to do his own thinking, and,
secondly, to train him properly in the expression
of what ideas he has.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B"></a>APPENDIX B</h2>

<p class="center big">THE TEACHER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD
CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</p>


<p>Two things must be admitted at the start&mdash;first,
that no person is qualified to judge the value of
new books who is not well acquainted with the old
ones; second, that the only test of the real greatness
of any book is Time. It is, of course, vain to hope
that any remarks made on contemporary authors
will not be misrepresented, but I have placed two
axioms at the beginning of this article in order to
clear the ground. I am not advocating the abandonment
of the study of Homer and Vergil, or proposing
to substitute in their stead the study of Hall Caine,
Mrs. Ward, and Marie Corelli. I do not believe that
Mr. Pinero is a greater dramatist than Sophokles,
or that the mental discipline gained by reading <i>The
Jungle</i> is equivalent to that obtained in the mastery
of Euclid.</p>

<p>I am merely pleading that every thoughtful man
who is alive in this year of grace should not attempt
to live his whole life in the year 400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, even though
he be so humble an individual as a teacher. The
very word "teacher" means something more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
"scholar"; and scholarship means something more
than the knowledge of things that are dead. A good
teacher will remember that the boys and girls who
come under his instruction are not all going to spend
their lives in the pursuit of technical learning. It
is his business to influence them; and he cannot
exert a powerful influence without some interest in
the life and thought of his own day, in the environment
in which his pupils exist. I believe that the
cardinal error of a divinity-school education is that
the candidate for the ministry spends over half his
time and energy in the laborious study of Hebrew,
whereas he should study the subjects that primarily
interest not his colleagues, but his audience.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"Priests<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should study passion; how else cure mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who come for help in passionate extremes?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A preacher who knows Hebrew, Greek, systematic
theology, New Testament interpretation, and who
knows nothing about literature, history, art, and
human nature, is grotesquely unfitted for his noble
profession.</p>

<p>In every age it has been the fashion to ridicule and
decry the literary production of that particular time.
I suppose that the greatest creative period that the
world has ever known occurred in England during
the years 1590-1616, and here is what Ben Jonson
said in 1607: "Now, especially in dramatic, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
as they term it, stage-poetry, nothing but ribaldry,
profanation, blasphemy, all license of offence to
God and man is practised. I dare not deny a great
part of this, and am sorry I dare not." In 1610 he
wrote, "Thou wert never more fair in the way to be
cozened, than in this age, in poetry, especially in
plays; wherein, now the concupiscence of dances
and of antics so reigneth, as to run away from nature
and be afraid of her, is the only point of art that
tickles the spectators." And in 1611 he said, "In
so thick and dark an ignorance as now almost covers
the age ... you dare, in these jig-given times,
to countenance a legitimate poem." And the age
which he damned is now regarded as the world's
high-water mark!</p>

<p>A man who teaches physics and chemistry is
supposed to be familiar not only with the history
of his subject, but its latest manifestations; with the
work of his contemporaries. A man who teaches
political economy and sociology must read the most
recent books on these themes both in Europe and
America&mdash;nay, he must read the newspapers and
study the markets, or he will be outstripped by his
own pupils. A man who teaches drawing and
painting should not only know the history of art, but
its latest developments. And yet, when the teacher
of literature devotes a small portion of the time of his
pupils to the contemplation of contemporary poets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
novelists, and dramatists, he is not only blamed
for doing so, but some teachers who are ignorant
of the writers of their own day boast of their ignorance
with true academic pride.</p>

<p>A teacher cannot read every book that appears;
he cannot neglect the study and teaching of the recognised
classics; but his attitude toward the writers
of his own time should not be one of either indifference
or contempt. The teacher of English literature
should not be the last man in the world to discover
the name of an author whom all the world is talking
about. And I believe that every great university
should offer, under proper restrictions, at least one
course in the contemporary drama, or in contemporary
fiction, or in some form of contemporary
literary art. The Germans are generally regarded
as the best scholars in the world, and they never
think it beneath their dignity to recognise living
authors of distinction. While the British public
were condemning in true British fashion an author
whom they had not read&mdash;Henrik Ibsen&mdash;German
universities were offering courses exclusively
devoted to the study of his works. Imagine a course
in Ibsen at Oxford!</p>

<p>But not only should the teacher take an intelligent
interest in contemporary authors who have already
won a wide reputation, he should be eternally
watchful, eternally hopeful&mdash;ready to detect signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of promise in the first books of writers whose names
are wholly unknown. This does not mean that he
should exaggerate the merits of every fresh work, nor
beslobber with praise every ambitious quill-driver.
On the contrary,&mdash;if there be occasion to give an
opinion at all,&mdash;he should not hesitate to condemn
what seems to him shallow, trivial, or counterfeit, no
matter how big a "seller" the object in his vision
may be. But his sympathies should be warm and
keen, and his mind always responsive, when a new
planet swims into his ken. One of the most joyful
experiences of my life came to me some years
ago when I read <i>Bob, Son of Battle</i> with the unknown
name Alfred Ollivant on the title-page.
It was worth wading through tons of trash to find
such a jewel.</p>

<p>And is the literature of our generation really
slight and mean? By "Contemporary Literature"
we include perhaps authors who have written or who
are writing during the lifetime of those who are now,
let us say, thirty years old. Contemporary literature
would then embrace, in the drama, Ibsen, Björnson,
Victor Hugo, Henri Becque, Rostand, Maeterlinck,
Sudermann, Hauptmann, Pinero, Jones, and others;
in the novel, Turgenev, Tolstoi, Dostoievsky, Björnson,
Hugo, Daudet, Zola, Maupassant, Heyse,
Sudermann, Hardy, Meredith, Stevenson, Kipling,
Howells, Mark Twain, and many others; in poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
to speak of English writers alone, Tennyson, Browning,
Arnold, Swinburne, Morris, Kipling, Phillips,
Watson, Thompson, and others. Those who live
one hundred years from now will know more about
the permanent value of the works of these men than
we do; but are these names really of no importance
to teachers whose speciality is literature?</p>

<p>Dr. Washington Gladden considered this book of sufficient importance to
take it and the text from which the title was drawn as his subject for an
entire sermon, in the course of which he said: "In its ethical and social
significance it is the most important piece of fiction that has lately appeared
in America. I do not think that a more trenchant word has been
spoken to this nation since 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' And it is profoundly
to be hoped that this book may do for the prevailing Mammonism what
'Uncle Tom's Cabin' did for slavery."</p>

<p>"Mr. White has written a big and satisfying book made up of the elements
of American life as we know them&mdash;the familiar humor, sorrows,
ambitions, crimes, sacrifices&mdash;revealed to us with peculiar freshness and
vigor in the multitude of human actions and by the crowd of delightful
people who fill his four hundred odd pages.... It deserves a high
place among the novels that deal with American life. No recent American
novel save one has sought to cover so broad a canvas, or has created
so strong an impression of ambition and of sincerity."&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening
Post.</i></p></blockquote>

<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.50</i></span>
</p>

<p>"'Other People's Houses' possesses that distinction of style in which
most of our current American fiction is so lamentably deficient, and it
has in addition the advantage of a theme which is a grateful relief from
the usual saccharine love story admittedly designed to suit the caramel
age.... Miss Dewing has a fine feeling for comedy and gives evidence
of both genuine talent and a fresh and vivid outlook upon life."&mdash;<i>New
York Times.</i></p>

<p>"It is a story rich in atmosphere, in allusion, and in vistas.... The
story is full of action. The characters have virility and in certain instances
charm, and the course of the story awakens no little concern on the part
of the reader. An interesting, varied, and amusing group of persons is
presented, and, ... take it for all in all, it is a work of taste, discrimination,
and power.... Its publishers may congratulate themselves on
having come upon another oasis in the present desert of American fiction."&mdash;<i>Chicago
Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"If an unknown author is to keep an entire novel to this level, that
author will be unknown no longer, but at a single bound has reached the
height, not only of good American novelists, but of any novelist doing
fiction in these days."&mdash;<i>Chicago Post.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. W. D. Howells says in the <i>North American Review</i>: "What I

</p>

<p>"To any one who has a genuine interest in American literature there is
no pleasanter thing than to see the work of some good American writer
strengthening and deepening year by year as has the work of Miss Ellen
Glasgow. From the first she has had the power to tell a strong story,
full of human interest, but as the years have passed and her work has
continued it has shown an increasing mellowness and sympathy. This
is particularly evident in 'The Romance of a Plain Man.'"&mdash;<i>Chicago

</p>

<p>The stirring story of a man who rises by force of sheer ability and perseverance
from the humblest beginning to a position of fame and influence.
The elemental strength, the vigor and determination of Martin Eden,
make him the most interesting character that Mr. London has ever
created. The plan of the novel permits the author to cover a wide
sweep of society, the contrasting types of his characters giving unfailing
variety and interest to the story of Eden's love and fight.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Major has selected a period to the romance of which other historical

romantic situations.</p></blockquote>

<p>"'The Three Brothers' seems to us the best yet of the long series of these
remarkable Dartmoor tales. If Shakespeare had written novels we can
think that some of his pages would have been like some of these. Here

such as might have come straight from Elizabeth's day.... The book
is full of a very moving interest and is agreeable and beautiful."&mdash;<i>The

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
